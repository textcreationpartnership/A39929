            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THe great ends for which we are ſet and maintained in this world, are <hi>1.</hi> To get <hi>new hearts,</hi> and prepare for another world that is to come. <hi>2.</hi> To live to, and walk with God, and ſerve our Generation; and in, and by our ſo do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, to look for, and receive from God, the por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Bleſſings he hath provided for, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to beſtow on us here. We are all, and every one of us, indiſpenſably bound to endeavour all we can to obtain and proſecute theſe ends, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe otherwiſe we ſhall all periſh. In this world we have our day of Grace to fit us for glory; if we are wiſe, and do faithfully improve it, we ſhall aſſuredly reap the fruits of it in another world; yea, the earneſt or firſt-fruits of it here. You have but a little uncertain time here to run your Race in, and to prepare for Eternal Life, and if
<pb facs="tcp:44192:3"/>you neglect to do it to purpoſe here, you will moſt certainly be ſhut out of Heaven hereafter, <hi>Mat. 25.1-13. v.</hi> If you trifle in this matter, and ſeem indifferent, you are not wiſe, but play the fool, and err exceedingly, as you will find to your coſt at the laſt day, if not before. To prevent which, and to make you truly wiſe, ſenſible, ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and diligent, in and about your everlaſting concerns, I have written this little Book, and do preſent it to your ſerious and faithful conſideration and improvement, and that in and with unfain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed love and cordial affection: For I do aſſure you, that I have bowels of love for you, and with all my heart and ſoul do pray for, and endeavour your Regeneration and Salvation, which I hope you ſee, and are convinced of, by my conſtant, free, and unwearied labours amongſt you, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to my ſmall Talent. The great and holy God knows, that I ſeek not yours, but you, as I hope you can all bear me witneſs; having once and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain told you, that I had Dedicated my poor La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours as a Free-will Offering unto God, and the ſervice of your Souls; and that I did not look for, or expect any reward from you for my pains, but your holy and ſpiritual improvement of them, to the glory of God, and your own Eternal Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The Truths here preſented to your eyes to read, were firſt (you know) preached to your ears to hear; but knowing how treacherous and weak
<pb facs="tcp:44192:3"/>our memories are, and how apt we are to let ſlip that which we hear; and alſo fearing that the great Doctrine of Regeneration, and your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernments in it, might by this time be worn (very much) out of the minds and hearts of many of you, I thought it a neceſſary and uſeful work to provide (as well as I could) for the reviving of it on you, and faſtening it in your hearts, by writing and compoſing the ſum and ſubſtance of what I preached to you, which here I have done. I have endeavoured to contract the whole within as narrow a compaſs as I could, and to hold forth great Truths unto you, with all poſſible plainneſs. You may not expect a large Epiſtle from me, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I want opportunity to do it at this time; and therefore ſhall ſum up all I have to ſay in a few words.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <hi>1.</hi> I do entreat you to read and ponder well what you ſhall find here written, and importune the Lord to give you much ſpiritual wiſdom and underſtanding, that you may be enabled to make a right judgment of the glorious Truths herein revealed.</p>

            <p>I Shall begin this <hi>Lecture,</hi> (which you have deſired, and are now waiting on) with the Doctrin of <hi>Regeneration:</hi> becauſe it is one of the great fundamental and Soul-ſaving Doctrins that you ſhould firſt underſtand, and be early and experimentally acquainted withall. Here God begun with
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:44192:7"/>Ignorant and unregenerate <hi>Nicodemus,</hi> and here he begins to open the door of everlaſting Life unto ſuch as he will ſave; and by Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation you muſt begin to ſeek for and expect Salvation, and eternal Glory. It is the Lords fixed and conſtant way, to ſend down and infuſe into the hearts of men the firſt fruits of Heaven, in order to his poſſeſſing them in the fullneſs of everlaſting Glory in Heaven.</p>
            <p>The ſeeds of ſpecial grace ſown in the Soul in Regeneration, are the earneſts and firſt fruits of Heavens glory. And as it is a certain Truth, that without Regeneration here, men cannot be ſaved hereafter; ſo it is as certain, that whoever are really Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated here, they ſhall be ſaved hereafter.</p>
            <p>This is a Truth that nearly concerns every one of you, and therefore requires your ſerious attention and conſideration; for here God will begin to ſave you, if ever you be ſaved.</p>
            <p>The words in the <hi>Text</hi> are ſpoken by Jeſus Chriſt unto <hi>Nicodemus,</hi> as you may read in the 1. &amp; 2. <hi>verſes.</hi> The ſubject matter of the <hi>Text</hi> is, or contains Regeneration, or the Renova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of men, in order to their eternal Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation; and they are ſpoken to and intended for us, as well as <hi>Nicodemus,</hi> becauſe we are all by nature in as had and miſerable a condition as he, and ſtand in as much need of Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration and the Doctrin thereof, as <hi>Nicodemus</hi> did when Chriſt ſpake theſe words to him;
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:44192:7"/>and therefore obſerve how Chriſt words the matter, <hi>verily, verily, I ſay unto thee; except a man be born again.</hi> That is, unleſs thou <hi>Nico<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demus,</hi> to whom I do now immediately direct my Doctrin, and other perſons in thy pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent caſe and condition; except a man, that is, thou, or any other man, be born again, <hi>he cannot ſee the Kingdom of God,</hi> ſo <hi>verſ.</hi> 5. And it is obſervable how the Lord Jeſus uſhers in the matter or Doctrin of Regeneration in the <hi>Text, and verſ.</hi> 5. tis <hi>with a double aſſevera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; verily, verily, (Text)</hi> and again, <hi>verily, verily</hi> 5. <hi>verſ.</hi> which informs us of theſe <hi>four things;</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt that the matter of Chriſt was ſpeaking of, was a very great and weighty matter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, and ſuch as <hi>Nicodemus,</hi> and other men, were indiſpenſibly bound on pain of eternal death, to take notice of, and concern them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves about with all poſſible diligence and faithfulneſs; for it was for their Lives, <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept a man be born again, he cannot ſee the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God;</hi> that is, he cannot be ſaved. And therefore he quickens and provokes the minds of men to ponder the matter, and lay it to heart, by his <hi>verily, and verily, I ſay,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That we are dull of hearing, and ſlow of heart to believe, and apply this great Doctrin to our own Souls; but to imagin and fancy that we ſtand in no, or very little need of it; and therefore may overlook, ſlight, and neglect it, as moſt men do. 3. That the Lord Jeſus is very ſerious, hearty, and earneſt with men, in perſwading them to ſeek
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:44192:8"/>after Regeneration, and that he doth really and unfainedly deſire to ſee them ſerious in that ſo great concern of theirs, and to labour after it to purpoſe. 4. That there is ſuch a thing as Regeneration, and that men may be Regenerated if they will not ſlight and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe it. Theſe and other ſuch things were in the eye and heart of Chriſt towards men, in ſpeaking thus to them, which he would have them believe, and think on, in his <hi>veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſhall have occaſion in my proceedures to ſpeak further to this <hi>Text,</hi> and therefore ſhall ſpeak no more of it now, but proceed to what I intend to commend to your ſerious conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations. Theſe are the moſt material heads I am to diſcourſe on, which I ſhall do, by way of Queſtion and Anſwer.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Queſt.</hi> What is Regeneration? wherein does it conſiſt, or what does it contain or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port?</p>
            <p>Anſw. <hi>Regeneration, is a ſpecial, powerful, and ſaving work of God, on a ſinner; changing and renewing his whole man, by infuſing a meaſure of the Spirit, and ſpecial grace of Christ into him, through the Miniſtry of the Goſpel, and that for holy and gracious ends and purpoſes.</hi> This is the beſt definition I can give you of Regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and I think it will ſerve, and do well enough, if rightly underſtood and improved by you. If any material thing be found wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, it may be afterward ſupplied. I ſhall
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:44192:8"/>take abroad the parts of the definition, and briefly clear and prove it; and then pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> You have the <hi>Author and Worker</hi> of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation; that is God. God is the ſole and only Author of it, without the help or aſſiſtance of men. God needs none of their help, neither can they afford him any at all, towards their Renovation; and therefore it is God alone.</p>
            <p>For firſt, men are all <hi>dead in ſins and Treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſes,</hi> Eph. 2.1, 5. and therefore cannot move themſelves, to produce new habits or prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of that they have not, nor can they ſet forward the great work of Regeneration in themſelves, for want of Life to act with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Blind.</hi> They are in groſs darkneſs, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 60.2. They cannot ſo much as ſee where, nor what they are, nor where they are going, <hi>Joh.</hi> 12 35. They are born blind, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue ſuch. They ſee not the Light that ſhines round about them; <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.5. much leſs can they direct themſelves in procuring, or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warding their own Regeneration.</p>
            <p n="3">3. There is nothing in them to make uſe of, towards the production of it, but very much to impede and hinder the work. They will it not, neither will they ſuffer God to do it, until he hath mightily perſwaded and bowed them to yield; <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.13. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 110.3. therefore it is not in them to work it in themſelves. As <hi>they will not come to Chriſt that
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:44192:9"/>they may have Life,</hi> Joh. 5.40. ſo they will not have him to come and create his Life in them.</p>
            <p>Therefore, it muſt be of God alone, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the concurrance of ſecond cauſes in men. And I ſay 'tis the work of God, and not of one of the glorious perſons only, (although the work be eſpecially attributed to the holy Ghoſt) but God the father hath his Almighty hand imployed in the work. <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.19, 20. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.3. and ſo hath Jeſus Chriſt his ſon too, <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.21. <hi>Joh.</hi> 10.10. ſo it is alſo the holy Spirits work. <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.5. <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.5. The Reaſons why the Scripture tells us all the perſons in the God-head have their hand in the work of Regeneration, are, <hi>First,</hi> to ſhew, and impreſs a deep ſenſe of the exceeding greatneſs and excellency of the work, on the hearts of Regenerate perſons: that they might be induced thereby to admire and value it, and to have it in high eſteem, as a moſt excellent and glorious work indeed, which had ſo many hands of infinite wiſdom, power, and love exerciſed and imployed about the effecting of it. 2. That they might be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected and provoked thereby, to aſcribe all the glory unto all the three perſons, and not to the holy Ghoſt only.</p>
            <p>'Tis true, that men unregenerate ought to uſe Gods means in order to Regeneration; they are to hear the Goſpel preached, read the Scriptures and good Books, and to pray to God to Regenerate them; becauſe God hath
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:44192:9"/>commanded them ſo to do. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.25, 26, 27, 37. <hi>Luk.</hi> 11.13. and alſo becauſe they are the ways and means of Gods own appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting for their Regeneration, whereby he will work it. <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.18. <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. <hi>Joh.</hi> 15.3. But yet your uſing the means and waiting in them, cannot Regenerate you, until God put forth his Almighty power in them, and form a new Creature in you. God tells us again and again, that it is his work alone, and that there is none to help him. <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.8, 9, 10. <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.5. to take off all boaſting from men, <hi>and that he that glories, might glory in the Lord,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.31.</p>
            <p>'Tis ſaid to be a ſpecial, powerful, and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving work (of God) to diſtinguiſh it from thoſe common and ordinary works, or work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of God on many, which never ariſes to, or Iſſues in real Regeneration on their Souls. Firſt, it is <hi>a ſpecial</hi> work; it differs not only in the degree or meaſure of it, but in the kind. There is a <hi>ſpecifical difference</hi> between what God works in, and beſtows upon ſuch as he Regenerates, and others who are never Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generated, although he beſtows many Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual gifts on them. 1. In the root and ſpring of his gifts and favours, Namely, his <hi>Love in Chriſt.</hi> That is the Fountain and efficient cauſe of their Regeneration, or of the grace and power whereby they are Regenerated. <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.4, 5. <hi>Deut.</hi> 7.6.7. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> God had loved and choſen them in the Lord Jeſus, to be a peculiar people unto himſelf, and therefore
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:44192:10"/>Regenerates, and makes them ſuch by his grace.</p>
            <p>But God doth not ſo love others, neither hath he choſen them in Chriſt, and Sanctified them to his uſe, to be his <hi>peculiars,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he never effectually Regenerates them. <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.21, 22, 23, 24, 25. And yet no one perſon is denied Regenerating grace, but ſuch as by their own wickedneſs do procure it unto themſelves: and therefore none ſhall have cauſe to complain of partial, unjuſt, or cruel dealing from the God of Truth, with whom is no unrighteouſneſs.</p>
            <p n="2">2. There is a difference in the grace its ſelf, although it is hard to expreſs and clear it, to your Apprehenſions, yet a wide difference there is between the grace and gifts of the Spirit on men, ſome are awakened, enlightened and reformed by the holy Ghoſt, which never are indeed Regenerated. I ſhall not diſcourſe of the differences here, but only ſhall tell you, that ſpecial grace hath virtue in it to enliven, as well as to enlighten, to quicken dead Souls, and revive dead hearts, as well as to enlighten the head. Common grace may put Light into the head, but never quickens and enlivens the heart, but ſpecial grace doth both; and that from its own nature and tendancy; <hi>for it is given for that end, Namely, to cauſe the dead to live, and the blind to ſee Spiritual things Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally.</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. There is a generative and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newing nature and virtue in the one, that is not in the other. But more of this elſewhere.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:44192:10"/>3. There is alſo a ſpecifical difference in the ends, ſpecial grace is given by the God of Love, and from the Love of God to ſome, to conform them to, and mould them for the Lords ſpecial uſe and ſervice, to make them lovely and aimable; pleaſing and delightful to him; that he may delight in them, and they in him, and be made capable of Communion with himſelf. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.9. <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.21, 23. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.3. <hi>That they may be veſſels of honour fitted for his uſe; live to him, and not unto them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.20, 21. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.14, 15. and alſo that they may live in the fruition and preſence of God for ever, in another world.</p>
            <p>But now common graces are not given for theſe ends, becauſe they cannot effect them. They leave men in as bad a ſtate as they found them in. Their hearts are not changed, neither made new Creatures by them, but remain under the reign and power of their luſts, and are Lovers and obeyers of them under their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon grace.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It is the powerful work of God; that is, Regenerating grace is <hi>Irreſistable.</hi> It carries all before it, and prevails. It is mighty in oppoſing, reſiſting, and conquering all its Enemies; to proſecute and obtain its ends, which the common works of God are not, (as experience ſhews) where Regenerating grace comes, it diſlodges Satan, and <hi>turns him out of his Throne, Luk.</hi> 11.21.22. <hi>Luk.</hi> 10.18. It ſilences carnal ſelf, and fells down luſts. <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.16. makes the old man bow down, yea,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:44192:11"/>and all the ſtrong-holds of ſin and Satan, fall before it. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.4.5. It will not be baffled as common grace is; for that gives place to Luſts and Temptations upon every aſſault; but Regenerating grace is ſo mighty and powerful, as that it takes the ſtrongeſt Caſtles, diſarmes the ſtouteſt Souldiers, and levels the ſtrongeſt and higheſt Bulworks of ſin, world, and devil; ſo that it effectually ſubdues and captivates all oppoſers, and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions whatſoever, and makes the whole Soul to yeild ſubjection to, and comply with it. It makes men willingly deſert their old delights, &amp; break their former confederacies, and to put themſelves under the yoke of Chriſt, and chuſe his ſervice.</p>
            <p n="3">3. It is a ſaving work of God. It is not for a time as the common work of grace is, <hi>Math.</hi> 13.20, 21. but it is for ever, Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration is little in the ſeed, but grows to a great Tree. Men are Regenerated for Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.1, 6. and it will not fail, or miſs of its end. Regeneration is the ea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>neſt and firſt fruit of Salvation, and Gods power is engaged to nouriſh and keep it to Salvation, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1 3, 4, 5. therefore they cannot loſe the very end of it. God would never beſtow the grace of Regeneration on men, if he had not firſt deſigned their eternal Salvation to be obtained in that way; but he having decreed and appointed; deſigned and determined the ſaving of Souls, by or through Regeneration; all that he Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:44192:11"/>ſhall be ſaved. And therefore I call it the ſaving work of God, becauſe it ſhall cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly Iſſue in their everlaſting Salvation, notwithſtanding their oppoſitions, weakneſſes and ſins.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The ſubjects of Regeneration, Namely, ſinners, that is Ignorant, vile, wicked, and abominable men. Not ſuch as have purified themſelves, made ſatisfaction to God for former injuries; ſuch as are worthy or meet for the grace of God, or ſuch as are friends, and to whom God is engaged for any good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of theirs, or ſervice they have done him; no, but God of his free grace Regenerates ſinners, while they are yet ſinners and ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. God finds them ſinners, and by Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, makes them Saints; of hateful per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, he makes them lovely and beloved; of enmies, he makes them friends, and of ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers he makes them intimates. God ſays unto men <hi>in their blood, live, Ezek.</hi> 16.6. <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.3, 4, 5. and the vileſt of ſinners <hi>he waſhes.</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.9, 10.11. <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.9. - 20. Therefore here is great encouragement for all willing ſinners, how vile, filthy and abominable ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they have been, that they may be Rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated and made new Creatures.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Regeneration changes and renews the whole man. It is powerful and effectual on the whole body, Soul and Spirit, to revive, quicken and renew it. It affects every part, and 'tis influential to proſecute and obtain its ends throughout. As the natural Life
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:44192:12"/>diffuſes its ſelf into every part of the man, ſo doth the new Spiritual Life in Regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.23. The <hi>underſtanding</hi> is thereby <hi>enlightened,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet</hi> 2.9. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.6. the <hi>will</hi> is <hi>ſanctified</hi> and drawn to chooſe and cloſe up with the promiſes, Chriſt and the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of grace, and with the whole will of God. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 56.4. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.30. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 110.3. <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.13. <hi>Col.</hi> 2.6.</p>
            <p>The mind is Spiritualized and ſet on hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly objects. <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.20. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. <hi>ult. Rom.</hi> 8.5. The affections are quickened, enlivened, and run Heaven-ward, being riſen to a new Life with Chriſt. <hi>Col.</hi> 3.1, 2. in a word, the Conſcience is made tender and active, to do its work, and the whole of his converſation is changed; <hi>all things are become new.</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.17. The grace of God hath (in meaſure) ſeaſoned and leavened the whole man, within and without: there is not a faculty or mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Soul or Body untoucht, but grace runs thorow every part. But more of this anon. For I am now but pointing out to you the parts of the definition of Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Regeneration is wrought by infuſing a meaſure of the holy Spirit and ſpecial grace of Chriſt into a man. In <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.3. <hi>men are ſaid to be born from Heaven; and</hi> verſ. 5. <hi>to be born of the Spirit. The Spirit is called the Spirit of Chriſt,</hi> Rom. 8.9. <hi>and the grace of Chriſt,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. <hi>ult.</hi> and this Spirit and grace of Chriſt is ſaid to <hi>be in men, Rom.</hi> 8.11. and Chriſt
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:44192:12"/>by them <hi>dwells in men. Eph.</hi> 3.17. and ſays God in the New Covenant, <hi>I will put my Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit within them, and a new heart will I give them: Sprinkle clean water on them, and make them clean. Ezek.</hi> 36.25, 26, 27. So he <hi>puts his fear into mens hearts, Jer.</hi> 32.39, 40. and <hi>ſheds abroad his love in them, Rom.</hi> 5.8. A Believers new ſtate is twofold, 1. A ſtate of <hi>Juſtification.</hi> 2. <hi>Regeneration.</hi> Juſtification is Gods impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt to him, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitting and diſcharging him of Guilt and Condemnation, pardoning all his ſins, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voking the Sentence of the Law given out againſt him, removing the Curſe, and remit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the puniſhment due to him, and graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly accounting and declaring him perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly righteous in Chriſt, and receiving and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting him into favour and friendſhip, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. <hi>ult.</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.30. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53. <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.</p>
            <p>This is not Regeneration (though Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation and Regeneration are never ſeparated) for Regeneration is the work of God within us; Juſtification is the Act of God without us: Regeneration is not our Juſtification, neither is Juſtification our Regeneration, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though all that are Regenerated are alſo Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied. There is a great difference between the one and the other, which we muſt carefully underſtand, and conſider well, leſt we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found what ought to be diſtinguiſhed. God doth not Juſtifie us by Regenerating us; they are two diſtinct Acts, or works of God to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards us, and ſo we ought to underſtand,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:44192:13"/>and make improvement of them: Therefore (I ſay) in defining Regeneration, that it is the work of God, infuſing the Spirit and Grace of Chriſt into us, that you may diſtinguiſh it from Gods Act in Juſtifying us; for many poor Souls do miſerably confound them.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Regeneration is wrought by the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry of the Goſpel. God doth (ordinarily) Regenerate men by the Preaching of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel. By mens Preaching and hearing of the Goſpel, the holy Ghoſt is given unto men, to to change their hearts, and make them new Creatures. <hi>Acts</hi> 10.44. <hi>Gal</hi> 3.2. The Goſpel ſhews us, <hi>that faith comes by hearing, Rom.</hi> 10.17. that is, God works faith and all other graces in men by it, as in and by his own ordinance. By this Inſtrument <hi>he begets us again to a lively hope, Jam.</hi> 1.18. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.3. <hi>It is the power of God to Salvation. Rom.</hi> 1.16. and Chriſt tells us, <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.25. <hi>that the dead ſhall hear the voice of the ſon of God, and they that hear ſhall live.</hi> So <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55.3. This is Gods <hi>engin</hi> whereby he pulls down ſtrong holds, levels mountains, and overthrows the Devils Kingdom, as the blow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Rams horns did fell down the walls of <hi>Jericho.</hi> By this means the dead are raiſed to Life, the blind are made to ſee, <hi>Acts</hi> 26.18. and deaf ears are unſtoped. By the Goſpel, men are Tranſlated out of the Kingdom of darkneſs, into Chriſt's Kingdom of Light.</p>
            <p n="7">7. God Regenerates men to and for holy and gracious ends and purpoſes. <hi>They are created in Chriſt Jeſus unto good works, which God
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:44192:13"/>had before ordained that they ſhould walk in them. Eph.</hi> 2.10. <hi>That they that live ſhould not hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth live unto themſelves, but unto him that dyed for them and roſe again.</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.15. <hi>That they ſhould walk in newneſs of Life, and not ſerve ſin. Rom.</hi> 6.4, 6. God Crowns them with, and makes them the ſubject of his ſpecial grace, that they may be Agents of his glory, in bringing forth fruit worthy of their new ſtate.</p>
            <p>God hath great ends in beſtowing great grace, and ſpecial ends in giving ſpecial grace. God honours and beautifies men with his grace, that they may therewith adorn his Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel and exalt his name. By Regeneration God makes men loving and lovely, and mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tens them for communion with himſelf. I have (I think) ſaid enough to or of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finition of Regeneration, therefore ſhall ſay no more of it in this place.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Quest.</hi> Pray explain the great work of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation more fully, and ſhew us what thoſe works of God on men are, that do not amount to, or ordinarily Iſſue in Regeneration, that ſo we may clearly underſtand what Regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is not, and alſo what it is?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> I ſhall firſt ſhew what tis not. 2. What it is, more fully.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> Meer light in the head is not Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation. For men may have much Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual light without Spirittual Life. Some are enlightened, who fall away from the truth,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:44192:14"/>and become Apoſtates, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.4, 5, 6. <hi>and after they have known the way of Righteouſneſs, do turn from the holy commands of God,</hi> to their own wicked ways. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.21, 22. And we read of ſome <hi>who knew their Lords will, but did it not, Luk.</hi> 12.47. which ſhews that they were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Regenerated.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Men may have many and great convictions of ſin, and of their miſerable and wretched conditions by reaſon thereof; they may be under much trouble of Spirit, and cry out with tears and heart-grief, and they may mourn, and be in bitterneſs of Soul, in the ſight of their ſad caſe, and periſhing ſtate; and yet all may be blown over, and come to nothing, but end in ſin and eternal death. <hi>Pharoah</hi> crys out, <hi>I am wicked, Exod.</hi> 9.27. and <hi>Saul</hi> ſaw his wickedneſs, and wept, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24.16. and confeſſed his ſin, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 26.21. Wicked <hi>Ahab</hi> had conviction of, and was greatly troubled for his ſin, and humbled himſelf, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 21.27, 28, 29. ſo the <hi>Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites</hi> in the Wilderneſs, and afterward. <hi>Judas</hi> was troubled, and crys, <hi>I have ſinned, Matth.</hi> 26.3, 4. yet none of them were Regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Men may greatly reform their ways, and look like New Creatures; their Converſations may be white, while their hearts are black; they may have a clean out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, when they are foul and abominable within; they may appear beautiful to men, whileſt they are but whited Sepulchres, and
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:44192:14"/>full of all manner of wickedneſs within, <hi>Mat.</hi> 23.25, 26, 27, 28. they may be waſhed, and yet be ſtill Swine, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.22. and they may go for Saints amongſt men, whileſt they are Devils within: <hi>Judas</hi> was ſo; and the Lord Jeſus tells us, that <hi>many go in Sheeps cloathing, but are indeed Wolves, Matth.</hi> 7.15. Therefore meer Reformation is not Regeneration. Thou mayſt forſake many ſins whileſt thou loveſt them, and perform many duties that thou lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt not, but loatheſt. <hi>Herod</hi> was a Reformer, he did many good things, <hi>Mark</hi> 6.20. but he was not a New Man.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Thou mayſt have much ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual joy, and yet be ſtill an unregenerate man. Herod <hi>heard</hi> John <hi>preach with gladneſs, Mark</hi> 6.20. <hi>The ſtony-ground hearers had joy for a time,</hi> in the good ways of God, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.20. Thou mayſt have many <hi>taſts of the good Word of God, and the Powers of the World to come, Hebr.</hi> 6.4, 5. yea, thou mayſt have ſuch taſts of the Heavenly Gift, as to raiſe thy Soul <hi>to delight in drawing nigh to God</hi> in his Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Divine Worſhip, and continue in thy unregenerate ſtate, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 58.2.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, Thou mayſt believe the truths of the Goſpel, and on the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and yet be in an unregenerate ſtate and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition. Simon Magus <hi>believed, when in the gall of bitterneſs, and bond of iniquity, Act.</hi> 8.13.23. The <hi>rockie hearers did believe a while,</hi> but were afterward Apoſtates, <hi>Luk.</hi> 8.13. Chriſt his hearers are ſaid <hi>to believe on him, Joh.</hi> 8.30.
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:44192:15"/>yet in <hi>verſe</hi> 44. he calls them the children of the Devil; <hi>Ye are</hi> (ſays he) <hi>of your Father the Devil, and his works ye will do.</hi> The Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites mentioned in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 106.12, 13, 14. were ſaid to believe; and ſo may you have Faith, and believe, and yet be Hypocrites ſtill. You may think you do believe aright unto Salvation, when in truth you do not, but delude your own Souls.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, Thou mayſt be much in hearing and praying, and yet be an unregenerate man. Herod <hi>was a hearer of</hi> John, <hi>Mark</hi> 6.20. Hypocrites in <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> were great hearers of him, and <hi>he was to them as a very lovely Song, Ezek.</hi> 33.30, 31, 32. The three bad grounds were all hearers of the Goſpel, <hi>Matth.</hi> 13.18-22. but not a good hearer amongſt them; they were all ſtark naught, and ſo mayſt thou be alſo, who art a great hearer of good men; and then for praying, or rather ſaying of pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, thou mayſt pray often and long, and yet be an hypocrite, and an unregenerate man; yea, thou mayſt have the gift of prayer, and yet be a graceleſs man. The <hi>Scribes and Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees</hi> made many and long prayers, <hi>Matth.</hi> 23.14. So the hypocrites we read of in <hi>Job, Chap.</hi> 27.8.10. Many make ſuch prayers as God abhors, and will not hear, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1.14, 15.</p>
            <p>Seventhly, Thou mayſt be very ſtrict, and very ſevere in faſting and afflicting thy ſelf, and yet be an unregenerate man. The Scribes and Phariſees faſted and afflicted themſelves in the height of their hypocriſie, <hi>Luke</hi> 18.12.
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:44192:15"/>
               <hi>I faſt twice in the week: And wherefore have we faſted and afflicted our ſouls,</hi> ſay the hypocrites in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 58.3. and the like they did in <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon, Zach.</hi> 7.5, 6.</p>
            <p>Eighthly, Thou mayſt be a charitable man; I mean, thou mayſt give much Alms to the poor, and yet be an unregenerate man. The Scribes and Phariſees did ſo, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6.1, 2. <hi>Luk.</hi> 18.12.</p>
            <p>Ninthly, Thou mayſt be a zealous man for, and in Religion, and yet be in an unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate ſtate. <hi>Paul</hi> was ſo before his Rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, <hi>Act.</hi> 22.3. <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.14. The <hi>Jews had a zeal for God, when in their blindneſs and hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of heart, Rom.</hi> 10.2. Thou mayſt be of a warm zealous ſpirit, even whileſt thou haſt a carnal unregenerate heart.</p>
            <p>Tenthly, Thou mayſt have much Integri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and do many good things uprightly, or without deſigned guile or fraud towards God and men; <hi>Abimelech</hi> did ſo, with reſpect to <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Sarah, Gen.</hi> 20.5. to which God gave his teſtimony, (namely) that it was ſo indeed, <hi>verſe</hi> 6. <hi>Paul,</hi> while unregenerate, had a great deal of <hi>Moral Integrity; I have</hi> (ſays he) <hi>walked in all good Conſcience before God until this day, Acts</hi> 23.1. (Mark it) I have walked in all good Conſcience before God; he ſpeaks of his carriages towards God in his uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted ſtate. To the ſame purpoſe he ſpeaks of himſelf in <hi>Acts</hi> 26.4, 5, 9. But when he declares his ſincerity and integrity in walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing before God in his Regenerate State, he
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:44192:16"/>gives us another account of it, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.12. <hi>For our rejoycing is this, the teſtimony of our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience; that in ſimplicity and godly ſincerity,</hi> or as the Greek word reads it (<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>) that in, or with the ſimplicity and ſincerity of God, we have had our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation; and alſo by (ſays he) <hi>the Grace of God,</hi> to diſtinguiſh his Evangelical and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious integrity, from his moral and old ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity or integrity he had whileſt a Phariſee, and in an unregenerate condition: And <hi>Paul</hi> further tells us in <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.6. <hi>that concerning the Law, he was blameleſs;</hi> that is, he did act and walk according to his Knowledge and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience.</p>
            <p>Theſe ſeeming Graces, and good works, look like Regeneration, ſpecial Grace, and real good works, but in truth they are not ſo. Theſe are commonly taken for ſuch, and men conclude that they are Regenerate, and in a happy condition, becauſe they find ſuch things as theſe in and by themſelves; but aſſuredly, ſuch good things may be in you, and done by you in your unregenerate ſtates, yea, you may fear God, and love God, and be (in many things) conſcientious men; you may love the People of God, deſire their So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, and wiſh your Souls in their conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and yet be unregenerate men; you may be meek, humble, uſeful, and deſirable men, and be taken and accepted, reſpected and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured by, and of the beſt of men, as good and holy men, and all that while be in the
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:44192:16"/>gall of bitterneſs, and bond of iniquity; therefore it nearly concerns you to be ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and diligent in examining and trying your ſelves, whether or no you be ſuch as you ſeem to be, leſt you continue to ſeem to be what you are not, and ſo delude men, and deceive your own Souls; harden your ſelves in a preſumptious confidence, and flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter your ſelves to everlaſting deſtruction. I could have preſented you with many other things that look like Regeneration, but I may ſpeak ſomething more of this matter, when I ſhall characterize Regenerate perſons, or open Regeneration on another Head.</p>
            <p n="2">2. But I ſhall now give you a fuller expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the great work of Regeneration; the word is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, and ſignifies a new or ſecond ſtate. This is a compound word of <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, again, and <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, Generation: So Rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration is a <hi>New Birth;</hi> or as <hi>Peter</hi> expreſſes it, a <hi>being born again,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.23. The word is uſed in <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.5. and in <hi>Matth.</hi> 19.28. In <hi>Titus</hi> it is meant of the firſt Regeneration, or change of ſtate here; but in <hi>Matthew,</hi> it may import the ſtate of Grace here, and Glory hereafter. The words in the <hi>Text,</hi> and in 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.23. which are rendred <hi>born again,</hi> are of the ſame import, and ſignifie the ſame thing, or work of God on men; and ſo do thoſe expreſſions of <hi>begetting,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.3. <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.18. Indeed the work of Regeneration is variouſly expreſſed, and ſet out in Scripture by many ſignificant and divers words and
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:44192:17"/>phraſes; to ſhew us, that it is a great and glorious work of God on ſinners, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend it the more to our conſideration and acceptance, to explain and make it the clearer to our underſtandings, and to quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en and perſwade us to ſeek after it in good earneſt, to eſteem and value it, and to move Regenerate perſons to much thankfulneſs for it, and to provoke to walk worthy of it; to convince men that it is too great a work for them to do, that they are beholding to Free Grace and Omnipotent Power for it, and to lay them low, and make them vile in their own eyes. Now Regeneration is expreſt and ſet out to us in the Goſpel, ſometimes by <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newing us, Col.</hi> 3.10. <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.6. ſometimes by <hi>making us partakers of the Divine Nature,</hi> 2 Pet. 1.4. <hi>and ſtamping the Image of God on us, Col.</hi> 3.10. <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. ſometimes 'tis expreſſed <hi>by Gods writing his Law in our hearts,</hi> Jer. 31.33. Heb. 10.16. <hi>and by circumciſing hearts,</hi> Deut. 30.6. ſometimes <hi>by ſhedding abroad his love, and putting his fear into them,</hi> Rom. 5.5. Jer. 32.39, 40. as alſo <hi>by quickning the dead,</hi> Eph. 2.1.5. Joh. 5.21.25. ſometimes <hi>by Creation, or creating them in Christ Jeſus unto good works,</hi> Eph. 2.10. Col. 2.10. ſometimes <hi>by putting off the old man, and putting on the new,</hi> Col. 2.9, 10. Eph. 4.22, 23, 24. ſometimes <hi>by tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlation, or by tranſlating us from death to life,</hi> 1 Joh. 3.14. <hi>and out of darkneſs into the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Chriſt,</hi> Col. 1.13. ſometimes <hi>by opening blind eyes, and turning men from darkneſs to light,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:44192:17"/>and from the power of Satan unto God,</hi> Acts 26.18. ſometimes <hi>by Gods working us to will and do,</hi> Phil. 2.13. <hi>and working us for this ſelf-ſame thing,</hi> 2 Cor. 5.5. that is, preparing us for another world; and ſometimes <hi>by calling us by his Grace,</hi> Gal. 1.6. <hi>to be Saints; to holineſs,</hi> 1 Pet. 1.14. <hi>and to newneſs of life.</hi> Regeneration is held forth to us by ſuch expreſſions, and works of God in and upon us; it includes all theſe, and ſeveral other mentioned in Scripture. But I have more to ſay for the unfolding and clearing this great truth to you, who deſire to learn.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Regeneration, Renovation, or the New Birth, is made up of all and every Grace of Chriſt: I mean the ſeeds and firſt fruits of all Grace, Chriſt imparts and infuſes a mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of all his Grace in regenerating a man; he opens the Fountain and Treaſury of his Grace and Fulneſs by the hand of the Holy Ghoſt, he conveys it into our hearts, <hi>Joh.</hi> 16.13, 14. yea, and the Holy Spirit himſelf gets into men, and <hi>dwells there, Rom.</hi> 8.10. as I ſhewed you before.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>What are the Graces of Chriſt, that conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes and forms the New Creature, or that makes the great Change?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Firſt <hi>Life.</hi> We are all by Nature <hi>dead in ſins,</hi> not only as under the Damning Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of the Law, but we are perſonally dead; that is, as the Body is dead without the Soul and Spirit that animates the Body, ſo without the Spirit and Grace of Chriſt,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:44192:18"/>our Souls, Bodies, and Spirits, are ſpiritually dead, as being <hi>without ſpiritual life, Eph.</hi> 2.1.5. <hi>Matth.</hi> 8.22. <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.25. Now when Chriſt Regenerates a man, he infuſes and conveys of his Life into him, and that enlivens the whole man. Hence Chriſt tells us, that <hi>he is the Life,</hi> Joh. 14.6. <hi>that he came to give Life,</hi> Joh. 10.10. <hi>that he quickens whom he will, and the dead ſhall hear his voice, and live,</hi> Joh. 5.21.25. And <hi>Paul</hi> tells us, <hi>that our life is hid with Christ in God,</hi> Col. 3.4. <hi>He is the Fountain of the Water of Life,</hi> which he invites men to come and drink, <hi>Rev.</hi> 22.17. <hi>Joh.</hi> 7.37. And he tells us further in <hi>Joh.</hi> 11.25. that he is <hi>the Reſurrection, and the Life; and that whoſo findeth him, findeth life, Pro.</hi> 8.35. So that Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration is a new Life, a Heavenly Life, and the Life of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>Light;</hi> ſpecial and peculiar Light. By Nature we are blind, walk in dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and know not whether we go, becauſe darkneſs hath blinded our eyes; we know neither Chriſt, nor our ſelves; there is a Vail before our eyes, ſo as that we cannot diſcern ſpiritual things and matters ſpiritually; they are all Myſteries unto us, and we cannot ſee them ſo as to love, prize, and eſteem them more than our luſts, and the things of this world. So the Goſpel tells us, that by Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture we are in <hi>darkneſs, Eph.</hi> 5.8. <hi>Acts.</hi> 20.18. and our calling <hi>is out of darkneſs,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.9. and the <hi>Light</hi> (that is Chriſt) <hi>ſhined in dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> (that is in mens hearts) <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.5. And
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:44192:18"/>we are told, that men by Nature are not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in darkneſs, but that <hi>they love it,</hi> or to abide in it, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.19. Now in Regeneration God cauſeth <hi>light to ſhine in our hearts, to give us the knowledge of the glory of God in the Face of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> 2 Cor. 4.6. And <hi>we are brought out of darkneſs into marvellous light,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.9. and by this light we are enabled to diſcern heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and ſpiritual things ſpiritually, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.9, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15. Our ſin and hypocriſie from God hath brought us into a Dungeon of darkneſs; and therefore it is abſolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, that God ſhould give us ſpiritual light in Regenerating us, to make us teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and tractable to know his will, and do it; for without this Light we cannot know, nor do it aright.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>Faith;</hi> Chriſt gives men Faith that they may believe in him, and in God the Father, as he commands them to do, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.1. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.21. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 8.23. <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.22. Men have no Faith, I mean no ſpecial and peculiar Faith of their own, whereby they can rightly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in Chriſt unto Salvation, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. <hi>ult.</hi> and therefore they muſt have it from him, and from him they have it in Regeneration; for he is the Fountain of Faith, as well as of Life and Light. <hi>All things are delivered to him of the Father,</hi> Matth. 11.27. <hi>and it pleaſed the Father that in him ſhould all fulneſs dwell,</hi> Col. 1.19. <hi>that of his fulneſs men might receive Grace for Grace, Joh.</hi> 1.16. Chriſt commands them to believe in him, and tells them that in ſo doing
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:44192:19"/>they ſhall have Eternal Life, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.16. and that they may ſo believe, and obtain Eternal Life, he beſtows of his own Faith upon them, which is a part of their New Life, or Rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration. This is a lively Faith, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.3. of the Operation of God, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.12. and <hi>it is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven them in the behalf of Chriſt,</hi> Phil. 1.29. And in <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.8. 'tis ſaid, <hi>not to be of our ſelves, but the gift of God;</hi> and preſently ſub<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>oyns, <hi>verſe</hi> 10. <hi>that we are Gods workmanſhip, created</hi> (or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generated) <hi>in Christ Jeſus unto good works,</hi> whereof believing is the moſt excellent, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.29. And in 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.3. the Apoſtle tells us, and bleſſes God, that he had <hi>begotten ſome Souls to a lively Faith or Hope;</hi> which ſhews that Faith and Hope are part of the New Creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: And the Faith whereby we believe in Chriſt unto the ſaving of our Souls, is called the <hi>Faith of Chriſt, Rom.</hi> 3.22. <hi>Eph.</hi> 3.11, 12. The Faith that meer natural men have, it is a <hi>dead Faith, Jam.</hi> 2.20.26. but the Faith of Chriſt is a part of the Life of Regeneration. We do not firſt believe that we may be quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and Regenerated, but we are firſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generated by the Spirit of Faith, and then we believe with a living, lively, and with a heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purifying Faith, <hi>Acts</hi> 15.9.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, <hi>Hope:</hi> Hope is a Grace of Chriſt, and a part of our Regeneration, or of the New Creature in us. Hence Regenerate per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons are called <hi>Children of Hope,</hi> 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.3. and in <hi>Col.</hi> 1.27. it is ſaid, that <hi>Chriſt is in them the Hope of Glory.</hi> Unregenerate men are ſaid to
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:44192:19"/>be <hi>without hope,</hi> while they are without God in the world, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.12. and when they are ſavingly called, or Regenerated, they are ſaid to be <hi>called in Hope, Eph.</hi> 1.18. and all belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers are <hi>called in one Hope, Eph.</hi> 4.4. that is, all have the ſame grace of Hope given them in their calling; and in 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.3. (before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named) they are ſaid to be <hi>begotten again to a lively Hope, by the Reſurrection of Chriſt from the dead.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fifthly, <hi>Love:</hi> Love is another Grace, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven from the God of all Grace in Regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Such as loved not God before, above the Creature, are enabled by Regenerating Love, to love him moſtly, heartily, obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently, and conſtantly. This Love is <hi>ſhed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad into the heart by the Holy Ghoſt, Rom.</hi> 5.5. and God is ſaid <hi>to give it to men by circumciſing;</hi> that is, by regenerating their hearts, <hi>Deut.</hi> 30.6. This is one of the Laws that God promiſes to <hi>write in their hearts, Jer.</hi> 31.33. God requires men to <hi>love him with all their hearts, minds, and ſtrength, Matth.</hi> 22.37. and that they may ſo do, he Regenerates them; that is, he gives them Regenerating Love; and this Grace helps to compleat the work of Regeneration in us. This Love is a Beam, a drop of that Love wherewith he loves his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect, and therewith Regenerate perſons love God again with the ſame love that he loves them; it is the ſame for kind, though not of the ſame degree; ſo that he who loves not God with all his heart, is not Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate;
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:44192:20"/>but he that doth, is certainly Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, <hi>Fear:</hi> Men have caſt off the fear of God, and fear not to offend him; but God will be feared by men, and requires them to do it <hi>all the day long, Pro.</hi> 23.17. Men in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed are naturally afraid of Gods Judgments, when they ſee or ſeel them, but they are not afraid of provoking God by their diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience and rebellion; men have caſt the fear of God behind their backs, but God will have ſome <hi>hearers of him;</hi> and therefore <hi>he puts it into their hearts, Jer.</hi> 32.39, 40. that with his Grace of holy fear, they may indeed <hi>ſtand in awe of him, and ſin not, Pſal.</hi> 4.4. There are no men in the world that fear God aright, but Regenerate perſons; and the fear of God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a part of their Regeneration, they do from the day of their New Birth begin to fear him, and ever after they are called <hi>Fearers of God, Pſal.</hi> 115. The Eye and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of God keep them in awe; God hath put fear into men and beaſts, to be a means to cauſe them to preſerve themſelves, and to keep them from hurting one another: So in Regeneration God puts his holy ſpiritual fear into their hearts, that they may not ſin againſt God, or wrong their own Souls. God hath promiſed to cauſe men to <hi>fear him,</hi> not ſo much for his Judgments, as for his <hi>Mercy and Co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>dneſs, Hoſ.</hi> 3.5. and this fear he put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Body of Regeneration, without which it will be imperfect.</p>
            <pb n="29" facs="tcp:44192:20"/>
            <p>Seventhly, <hi>Humility, Meekneſs:</hi> Theſe Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces (if they are two) are parts of the New Creature; they are the Beauty and Ornament of the New Creature, without which it would not be ſo amiable and lovely as now it is. We are by Nature exceeding proud, rug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, haughty, ſowre, and pieviſh Creatures, but God loves a meek and humble ſpirit; and therefore he Regenerates ſome with Humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Meekneſs, and the more men have of theſe, the more lovely they are to God and men, the more conformable to Chriſt, who was <hi>meek and lowly in heart, Matth.</hi> 11.29. Chriſt will have all his Members like him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; the Body muſt be like the Head; and Chriſt becoming their Head in Regeneration, he beſtows on them his Humility and Meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, which is a part of that fulneſs of Grace he hath received for his Members. Meekneſs is one of the glorious <hi>fruits of the Spirit, Gal.</hi> 5.22. <hi>and one of the Graces of Christ, Jam.</hi> 4.6. By Humility and Meekneſs Chriſt prepares and capacitates men for his ſervice, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with himſelf; to bow and bend them to his holy will, and make them obedient unto him in all things; for only the Humble and Meek are ſuch perſons and walkers.</p>
            <p>Eighthly, <hi>Zeal:</hi> Regeneration makes men zealous againſt ſin, and for God, and godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Before Regeneration men may have a <hi>zeal for God, but not the Zeal;</hi> it is not <hi>accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to knowledge, Rom.</hi> 10.2. True Goſpel-zeal is a glorious Grace of Chriſt infuſed into
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:44192:21"/>men in Regeneration, and that in purſuance of one of the great ends of Chriſt his death, <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.14. <hi>He gave himſelf to redeem us from all iniquity, and to make us a peculiar people, zealous of good works.</hi> Before men are Regenerated, they are zealous for their own gain, honour, pleaſure, and ſuperſtition; but Regeneration makes them zealous for God, with the Zeal of God. As ſoon as <hi>Paul</hi> was converted, he ſhewed himſelf a true and great Zealot in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed for Chriſt, Grace, Holineſs, and the Souls of men. It is holy Goſpel-zeal that makes men active for God, and puts them for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to follow their Light. Light in the Head, without Zeal in the Heart, may fill men with notions of duty, but never make them <hi>Practitioners</hi> of duty; they may know the Will of God, but they will not, they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be perſwaded to do it: 'tis true, that Zeal without knowledge is not good, and as true, that knowledge without zeal is unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable; Chriſt hath a fulneſs of zeal for men, and in Regeneration he imparts it to them.</p>
            <p>Ninthly, <hi>Prayer:</hi> In Regeneration Chriſt infuſes the Grace and Spirit of Prayer; as ſoon as <hi>Paul</hi> was Regenerated, <hi>behold he pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, Acts</hi> 9.11. He had often prayed before, for he was a zealous <hi>Phariſee,</hi> and <hi>concerning the Law he was blameleſs, Phil.</hi> 3.6. but he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver prayed aright until he was Regenerated, for then Chriſt gave him the grace of Prayer; he could then pray with Grace in his heart, and then, not till then, behold he prayeth.
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:44192:21"/>There are none can pray ſpiritually but New Creatures, for the voice of Nature is the voice of the fleſh, and <hi>what is of the fleſh is fleſh, Joh.</hi> 3.6. and that voice God is not pleaſed with, and heareth not; but it is the voice of the New Creature, which is form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and made up of the Grace and Spirit of Chriſt, that God <hi>heareth and delighteth in, Pro.</hi> 15.8. Therefore God promiſeth to give un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to men (in Regeneration) <hi>the Spirit of Grace and Supplication, Zach.</hi> 12.10. that they may thereby be enabled to pray unto God <hi>holily and acceptably,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.5. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.26, 27. <hi>God is a Spirit, and will be worſhipped in ſpirit and truth, Joh.</hi> 4.23, 24. and therefore he ſpirits them in Regeneration ſo to do. Men may ſpeak great and good words, and make plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible and ſeemingly good prayers from light in their heads, and other common ſpiritual gifts, without Regeneration, but they are but fleſhly, cold, dead, and loathſome prayers, becauſe they proceed not from a Divine Root and Spring; they are dead, their hearts are dead, and therefore their prayers muſt needs be dead prayers, which the Living God ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hors, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1. But now Regeneration opens their hearts and tongues, enlivens and quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens them, puts a heavenly Principle into them, ſo that now they can ſpeak to God with new tongues and hearts; now they can pray in Faith and Hope, with ſpiritual and lively affections, and in obedience to the Will of God.</p>
            <pb n="32" facs="tcp:44192:22"/>
            <p>Tenthly, <hi>Self-denial:</hi> Men are by Nature altogether <hi>ſelfiſh,</hi> they are wholly devoted to the ſervice of the fleſh, and ſet upon <hi>ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling the deſires of the fleſh, and of the mind, Eph.</hi> 2.3. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.5. <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.19. But God lays in Self-denying grace on their hearts in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation; ſo that now they can deny them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of their eaſe, pleaſures, profits, opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, relations, peace, and all their once belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Intereſts whatſoever, for God, Holineſs, Truth, and the welfare of their own Souls. They can, and that upon choice, diſpleaſe themſelves, to pleaſe God; they can willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be nothing, that <hi>Christ may be all in all things, Col.</hi> 3.11. yea, they would be the Footſtool of Chriſt to exalt him, and ſet him on the Throne. Regeneration makes them account their all too little for him, as before they accounted a little too much for Chriſt. This is the great term on which we receive and believe in the Lord Jeſus, <hi>Mark</hi> 8.34. <hi>Matth.</hi> 16.24. <hi>Luk.</hi> 9.23. and by Regeneration he gives them <hi>power and will to do it, Pſal.</hi> 110.3. <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.13. <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.44, 45. This Regenerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on wrought in <hi>Paul, Gal.</hi> 1.16. <hi>I conſulted not with fleſh and blood</hi> (ſays he) that is, as ſoon as he was Regenerated, Chriſt ſent him <hi>to preach the Faith which before he had</hi> zealouſly <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed, verſ.</hi> 23. and that amongſt the barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Heathens, where was much danger, and in the doing of which he ſhould meet with many difficulties, (as he did) yet he immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately yielded up himſelf to the Will of Chriſt,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:44192:22"/>and laid his own in the duſt. So when Chriſt called <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Andrew, they ſtraightway left all and followed him, Matth.</hi> 4.18, 19, 20. and after ward <hi>Matthew</hi> did the like; he preſently left his gainful Trade at the <hi>Cuſtom-Houſe,</hi> and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed Chriſt, <hi>Matth.</hi> 9.9. So the Diſciples tell Chriſt, <hi>Luke</hi> 18. <hi>that they had left all, and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed him;</hi> and the grace of Self-denial is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to all Regenerate perſons in the very mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their Regeneration.</p>
            <p>Eleventhly, <hi>Sincerity:</hi> This is the general grace, or that which is the <hi>Salt</hi> that ſeaſons and makes (as it were) all other grace good and ſingular. <hi>Goſpel-ſincerity</hi> is the holy ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual <hi>Leven,</hi> that runs through the whole Lump, or Body of the graces of Chriſt given in Regeneration; it is not properly one ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle grace, but it is rather the grace of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther graces; 'tis that which makes the ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fical difference between common and peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar grace, that makes a man to be what he ſeems to be; it makes and really qualifies a man, a truly godly and gracious man; it makes the heart, face, and tongue of a man the ſame towards God and men; it makes a man entire, and wholly for God, Chriſt and Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, according to his holy profeſſion; it brings up, and muſters all graces, ſets them in their places, and directs them all unto God in duties, and to thoſe holy ends for which he hath appointed them to be performed. <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel-ſincerity</hi> is a ſpecial gift of God beſtowed on men in Regeneration, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.12. <hi>that in
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:44192:23"/>the ſimplicity and ſincerity of God we have had our Converſation among you,</hi> (ſays <hi>Paul;</hi>) and he tells the <hi>Coloſians,</hi> that they had heard and known the <hi>Grace of God in truth, Col.</hi> 1.6. Goſpel-ſincerity hath all grace in the Womb of it; by it the Holy Ghoſt makes men a <hi>peculiar people unto God,</hi> qualifies and fits them for all ſpiritual and holy imployments, and Religious Exerciſes, for acceptance and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with God. This is it that makes men lovely, and deſirable to God and man, that makes them true and faithful to God, that draws forth and ingages their hearts to God, and cauſes them to yield up their wills to the Will of God. Without Goſpel-ſincerity men are but <hi>whited Sepulchres,</hi> and like the <hi>Apples of Sodom,</hi> beautiful without, but rotten and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bominable within. Mens Religion, I mean their profeſſion of it, without Goſpel-ſince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, is vain and unſavoury. Goſpel-ſincerity is that which makes us like God, <hi>Jer.</hi> 22.41. and that which ſpiritualizes and perſumes all our duties. All our duties muſt be done, and profeſſion of godlineſs made in Goſpel-ſincerity, or God will abhor both us and them, <hi>Joſhua</hi> 24.14. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.22. <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.23, 24. <hi>Iſai.</hi> 1. Therefore that God may have ſome to ſerve him in Spirit and Truth, he Regenerates them, and makes them New Creatures, by putting his own Nature, and ſtamping his own Image into, and upon them, and ſo they are made holy and ſincere, in meaſure, like unto himſelf. This is another glorious part
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:44192:23"/>of Regeneration. Theſe are ſome, and but ſome of the graces of Chriſt, that makes forms, and conſtitutes the Heavenly Babe, the New Creature. There are many other graces of Chriſt given to men in their Regeneration, to make a compleat New Creature; as <hi>Joy, Temperance, Patience,</hi> and ſeveral other, which I ſhall not now inſiſt on, nor mention, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I have many other Truths to open to you on this Subject. Let me then adviſe you, who think you are Regenerated, to examine and try your ſelves, if you can find indeed theſe graces of Chriſt in you; and if you you can, and do find them in you really, you may be ſure that all other graces (that have not been mentioned) are in you, and that you are in a ſtate of Regeneration; but if there be none of theſe graces in you, then you are in an unregenerate ſtate and condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>What have you further to ſay and declare of Regeneration?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> I ſay, that the Holy Ghoſt gets in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a man when he Regenerates him, and <hi>brings in all the Graces of Chriſt with him, Joh.</hi> 16.7, 8, 13, 14. as was ſhewed before, <hi>Rom,</hi> 8.9, 10, 11. And Chriſt is ſaid to be in Regenerate men by his Spirit and graces, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.17. and by regenerating them, he works in them new principles, habits, diſpoſitions, and ends, and he ſets up in their hearts and ſouls new Laws, namely, his own, to direct and guide them, to rule and order them; <hi>All things are
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:44192:24"/>become new in him,</hi> and to him, that is Rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.17.</p>
            <p n="1">1 There are <hi>new,</hi> that is, <hi>divine and heavenly Principles</hi> in him; there is Divine Light to ſee withal, and New Life to walk withal, in the ways of God; there is <hi>Love</hi> to move and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline his heart to his duty, <hi>Life</hi> to quicken, and <hi>Light</hi> to direct and guide him: ſo that his duties proceed from his new Principles of Light, Life, Faith, and Love. <hi>All things are become new in him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2 <hi>New Habits.</hi> His new Principles are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come fixed, ſtated habits in his Soul; he doth not move and act in the things of God by <hi>Forreign</hi> cauſes, and external motives only, as he did before Regeneration, but he acts and brings forth fruit from a ſtock of grace in his heart. In <hi>Matth.</hi> 12.35. Chriſt tells us, <hi>that a good man, out of the good t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eaſure of the heart, bringeth forth good things;</hi> that is, from a gracious fixed habit. His good works do naturally flow from him; he is fixed and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved at all times, to do and comply with the Will of God, in all ſtates and condit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ons whatſoever, not only when he hears or feels ſome ſtirring word, or provoking judgment, to quicken and irritate him, but alſo at other times, when none of theſe things do occur. Thus we find <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Paul, Pſal.</hi> 57.7. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. <hi>Acts</hi> 20.24. <hi>Acts</hi> 2. All things are new.</p>
            <p n="3">3 <hi>New diſpoſitions.</hi> Regeneration diſpoſes us to every good word and work; it is an ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitual diſpoſition, though it be ſometimes
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:44192:24"/>ſtronger, ſometimes weaker, yet they do ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuinely mind and will God, their duty, and eternal happineſs, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.18. <hi>For to will</hi> (ſays he) <hi>is preſent with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ne, but how to do it he knew not.</hi> And the ſame <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſhews us, that 'tis ſo with all good men, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.17. and they are ſaid to be <hi>ſpiritually minded, Rom.</hi> 8.5, 6. that is, the bent, inclination, deſire and intention of their hearts were ſo. Thus Regenerate men are ſaid to be <hi>ready to every good work, Acts</hi> 17.11. <hi>Tit.</hi> 3 1. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.11. <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.15. Regeneration diſpoſes them to <hi>pray in ſecret, Acts</hi> 9.11. to hear and learn the Will of God, <hi>Acts</hi> 17.11. ſo to be delivered from all ſin, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.24. <hi>to perfect holineſs, Phil.</hi> 3.13, 14. and as theſe, ſo all other things and duties what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever. It is true, that the carnal ſpirit in Regenerate perſons, doth greatly oppoſe and draw them backward, but yet that hinders not their holy diſpoſitions and inclinations, but they will breathe and operate in them, with a notwithſtanding, as good men do ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience. And indeed, this is one of Gods great and holy ends in regenerating men, namely, to move and incline their hearts unto himſelf, and his holy will, that they may move, will, aed act freely, by his Life and Power within them; that their habitual in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations and diſpoſitions may be ſuited to his will, and the things above, and that his external motives may ſweetly and freely draw, and not force and drive them to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and their duty. Hence the <hi>Spouſe</hi> prays
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:44192:25"/>Chriſt to <hi>draw her, and ſhe will run after him, Cant.</hi> 1.4. ſhewing thereby which way ſhe was diſpoſed and bent.</p>
            <p n="4">4 <hi>New ends and deſigns.</hi> All things are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come new with regenerate perſons, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore needs they muſt have new ends and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns in their eyes, and hearts; in their wills, underſtandings, judgments, minds, and affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions; as their ends and deſigns in things before Regeneration were baſe, low, and ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did, ſo now in a Regenerate ſtate they are high, noble, and honourable: They were wont to make the <hi>Lusts of the fleſh, of the eye, and the pride of life,</hi> the mark they ſhot at, and the point, ſcope, and end of all their projects, contrivements, and endeavours; but Rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration hath ſublimated and heightned their ſpirits, cauſed them to ſee, and carry on more worthy and glorious deſigns and ends; their hearts are in meaſure ſuited to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of God, and the end of Chriſt his. Death. This the Apoſtle notably declares, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.15. <hi>and that he died for all, that they that live,</hi> (that is, that are Regenerated, and begotten again to a lively hope) <hi>ſhould not henceforth live unto themſelves,</hi> (but to whom then?) why, <hi>to him who died for them, and roſe again.</hi> They are now <hi>partakers of the Divine Nature,</hi> and are of a heavenly deſcent; they are the ſpiritually natural and adopted Sons and Daughters of God, the Off-ſpring and Royal Iſſue of the King of Kings, and Lord of Lords; and therefore they muſt needs
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:44192:25"/>have aims, ends, and deſigns in their eyes and hearts, according to their new Nature, and Royal Spirits. Now their Hearts and Souls are bent and ſet to live in the <hi>Court,</hi> in the preſence of the King, to wait on, and do ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage to him, to honour, ſerve, and pleaſe him; to keep his favour, and ſmiles of his countenance; to know his pleaſure, and yield him free and chearful obedience thereunto; to inrich themſelves with his graces and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and prepare themſelves for full and ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Communion with himſelf. Now they deſire to hold up his Intereſt and Concerns in the world, to inlarge and augment his Kingdom, and to have their light ſo to <hi>ſhine in the world before men,</hi> as that they may ſee their good works, and be <hi>induced to glorifie God, Matth.</hi> 5.16. Theſe, and ſuch like glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious ends and deſigns, are in the New Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures eye; but to live, project, and contrive, to get and keep worldly riches, honours, pleaſures, beauty, and a great name, are things far beneath the Noble and excellent nature and ſpirit of the New Creature; it is of a Chriſt-like Spirit and Nature, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it muſt of neceſſity have and deſign the ſame ends he doth; <hi>Their old ends are paſſed away, and new take place.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5 <hi>New Rules, or Laws.</hi> Regeneration brings into a man, and puts him under new Laws, Orders, and Rules; <hi>All things are become new.</hi> Before Regeneration they were ruled and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned by the will of the Fleſh, the counſels
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:44192:26"/>of the Fleſh, the ſuggeſtions of Satan, and examples of carnal men, and accordingly they walked and ſteered their courſe, bleſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in ſo doing, promiſing peace and feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city to themſelves in thoſe ways of their own hearts, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 66.3. 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.3. But Regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion puts into them, and brings them under the Laws and Orders of Jeſus Chriſt, and the Kingdom into which they are <hi>tranſlated, Col.</hi> 1.3. The Laws written in the Goſpel, are by Regeneration written with the Finger of the Holy Ghoſt in their hearts; ſo that now they have (as it were) <hi>two Bibles,</hi> or Books of Laws, the one in their hand, the other in their hearts, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.33. <hi>Jer.</hi> 32.40. <hi>Heb.</hi> 8.10, 11. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.16. By theſe Laws and Rules, they deſire, chuſe, and endeavour to walk un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them, to live and be ſubject to them, and to none elſe. The New Creature knows no other Lord, Laws, or Law-giver, over it's Soul and Conſcience, but Chriſt; it freely yields up its ſelf to all chearful obedience to all his Laws, and accounts it his happineſs to walk by his Rules; he honours them, and is thankful for them.</p>
            <p>Theſe are his Laws upon choice, and his o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to them he eſteems as a great privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and honour, <hi>Deut.</hi> 4.8. He would not vary from them, but have them continually before him, in his eye, heart, and hand; he makes them his <hi>delights and Councellours,</hi> and they are the <hi>joy and rejoycing of his heart,</hi> as <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> and <hi>Jeremy</hi> experienced. When they vary
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:44192:26"/>from them, or in any thing tranſgreſs them, they are afflicted; and when they conform to them, they rejoyce.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>You ſaid before, that Regeneration ſignifies a change of ſtate, or a ſecond ſtate; pray ſhew what is meant by a ſecond, or new ſtate, that Rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration puts men into?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> I have ſhewed you already, that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation puts men into a new ſtate of life; it tranſlates and raiſes them from ſpiritual death, to ſpiritual life, from darkneſs to light, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> by the infuſion of the Spirit, Light, and Life of Chriſt: And ſeveral things have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready been diſcourſed on, which may not here be mentioned, but ſhall refer you to what hath been ſaid before. Here I ſhall add, ſecondly, that Regeneration <hi>tranſplants</hi> men out of the old <hi>Adam into the new;</hi> it takes them from the old ſtock, and grafts them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the new, out of the Earthy man, and <hi>puts them into the Heavenly,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. By Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration they are actually put into Chriſt, and Chriſt into them; they are taken out of the Kingdom of Satan, and put into the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Chriſt, as theſe Scriptures ſhew, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.9, 10. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.17. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.5. <hi>Col.</hi> 1.13. <hi>Acts</hi> 26.18. <hi>Joh.</hi> 18.36. Men are firſt put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Chriſt by <hi>Election,</hi> they are ſaid to be <hi>cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen in Chriſt, Eph.</hi> 1.4. and that <hi>before the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the World;</hi> and they were <hi>united</hi> to Chriſt in his <hi>Incarnation,</hi> when he took up our Nature into a Perſonal Union with the Divine; but in Regeneration, we are fully
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:44192:27"/>and compleatly, actually and perſonally uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to Chriſt, with our own choiſe, and free conſent; ſo that here is a great change in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed. Regenerate perſons are ſet into a new and living ſtock, which will yield ſufficient ſap and nouriſhment to ſuch grafts. <hi>I am the Vine,</hi> (ſays Chriſt) <hi>ye are the Branches, Joh.</hi> 15.5. And hence it is that they <hi>bear much fruit unto Eternal Life,</hi> after Regeneration, <hi>Joh.</hi> 15.5. <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.36. By Regeneration we are made Subjects of his Kingdom, and living Members of his Body, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.15. <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. <hi>ult. Eph.</hi> 5.30. They are now of another King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and Corporation, of another Root, Stock, and Body, of another Family and Houſhold, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.19, 20.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Regeneration puts men into a ſtate of <hi>liberty and freedom.</hi> In their unrege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate ſtate, they are in bondage, in priſon, and ſlavery to their <hi>Luſts, Rom.</hi> 6.17. to <hi>Satan,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. <hi>ult. Eph.</hi> 2.2. They are alſo in bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage under the <hi>Law,</hi> and enjoyned to keep e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very tittle of it, on pain of Eternal Death, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.10. <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.14. They are alſo by Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Children of wrath, <hi>as they are ſinners</hi> and tranſgreſſors of the Law, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.3. And they are, <hi>as ſinners,</hi> under the damning Sentence of the Law, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.18. Moreover, the Scripture tells us, that all men, while in their unrege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate ſtates, are <hi>Priſoners, Iſa.</hi> 61.1. and <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners in the Pit, Zach.</hi> 9.11. This, and much more, is their miſery and bondage, thraldom and ſlavery, while in their ſtate of ſin; but
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:44192:27"/>now Regeneration ſets them at liberty and freedom, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.1.13. Chriſt hath by his Death purchaſed their freedom and liberty, <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.14. but it is made theirs by, or in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation. Then he opens the Priſon doors, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 61.1. turns the Devil out of his Throne, <hi>Luke</hi> 11.21, 22. breaks off their bonds, and brings them out, ſets them at liberty, and lets them go free, and all by virtue of his blood, in purſuance of the Covenant, <hi>Zach.</hi> 9.11. Now they are ſaid to be <hi>free from ſin, and become the ſervants of God, Rom.</hi> 6.22. and <hi>the wicked one toucheth them not,</hi> 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.18. In Regeneration Chriſt leads <hi>Captivity captive, Eph.</hi> 4.8. It is a great, real, and Everlaſting Freedom that men have in Regeneration; they ſhall no more return into Captivity: <hi>If therefore the Son ſhall make you free, ye ſhall be free indeed, Joh.</hi> 8.36. Hence they are ever after Regeneration called the <hi>Lords Free-men,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.22. for by Regeneration they are put into the ſtate of liberty, not upon conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or for a time, but for ever. They are free from the Ruledom of Sin and Satan, from the <hi>Law of ſin and death, by the Law of the Spirit of Life, Rom.</hi> 8.2. By Regeneration they are made free to, and for God and Holineſs, to <hi>ſerve him without fear, in righteouſneſs and holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, all their days, Rom.</hi> 6.22. <hi>Luke</hi> 1.74, 75. So that now they have nothing elſe to do or mind, but how, as Free-men, to walk wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of their new ſtate, to live unto God, and bear fruit to his praiſe and glory; for they
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:44192:28"/>are now in a ſecure ſtate of freedom and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, and need not fear the loſs of it.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, By Regeneration we are put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a ſtate of <hi>Relation</hi> to God the Father, and Jeſus Chriſt the Son. In our unregenerate ſtates we are the <hi>Children of the Devil, Joh.</hi> 8.44. are his ſubjects and ſervants, and alſo the <hi>ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of ſin, Rom.</hi> 6.17, 18. and then we ſtood in no ſpecial Relations to Chriſt: For when we are made free from ſin by Regeneration, then, and not till then, we become the <hi>Lords ſervants, Rom.</hi> 6.22. God is indeed related to us, as our <hi>Creator,</hi> and we are related to him, as we are his Creatures; but this is no ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Relation, for the Devils are ſo related to God: But Regeneration puts us into ſeveral ſpecial Relations. (1.) Into a <hi>Conjugal Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi> Chriſt is Married to them, and they to him, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.2. <hi>Cant.</hi> 2.16. Chriſt is their Husband, and they are his Wife, as the Song of <hi>Solomon</hi> ſhews. (2.) God is their <hi>Father,</hi> and they are his Children, not as by the firſt Creation, but by Regeneration, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.12. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. <hi>ult. Iſa.</hi> 9 6. <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. (3.) Chriſt is their <hi>Head,</hi> and they are his Members, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.30. (4.) Chriſt is their <hi>Lord and King,</hi> and they are his Subjects and Servanti, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.6. <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.16.22. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2.6. (5.) Chriſt is their <hi>Shepherd,</hi> and they are his Sheep, <hi>Joh.</hi> 10.11.14.27. (6.) Chriſt is their <hi>Prophet,</hi> and they are his Scholars, <hi>Acts</hi> 3.22, 23. Theſe are ſome of the near Relations that Regenerate perſons ſtand in to Chriſt, and they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtated
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:44192:28"/>in them by Regeneration; for then they are contracted to Chriſt: <hi>I have</hi> (ſays <hi>Paul</hi>) <hi>eſpouſed you to Chriſt,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.2. name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, by the means of his Preaching to them; and ſo they are made Sons and Daughters, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.5.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, In Regeneration men are put into a ſtate of <hi>Righteouſneſs and Justification;</hi> not that they are Juſtified by Inherent Grace, or becauſe they are Regenerated, but that God doth by Regenerating them, enable them to take hold of Chriſt, and <hi>believe in him unto Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification of Life, Rom.</hi> 5.18. <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.22.25. So alſo, for that God doth actually and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonally juſtifie men, when he Regenerates and makes them New Creatures. Before Rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration men are in a guilty ſtate; they are in an unrighteous, and (as ſuch) in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned ſtate and condition; but by the means of Regeneration they are enabled to believe, receive, and apply the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt unto themſelves; and they can go to God the Father, and take out his <hi>Acquit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tances,</hi> and promiſed <hi>Diſcharges, Pardons,</hi> and <hi>Acceptance,</hi> bring home, and apply all unto themſelves; and ſo God accepts them, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quits and forgives them, diſcharges them of, and juſtifies them from and againſt all Crimes, Accuſations, and Indictments whatſoever and puts them into a Juſtified ſtate, or into a ſtate of Righteouſneſs and Juſtification, upon their believing in him, with the Faith given them in and by their Regeneration, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.33,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:44192:29"/>34. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. <hi>ult. Rom.</hi> 3.24.26. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.30.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, Regeneration puts men into a ſtate of <hi>Friendſhip</hi> with God. By Nature we are all Enemies to him, and God ſeems to be, and to carry himſelf towards us as an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.10. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 63.10. yea, we are by Nature worſe, and more than Enemies, for being in Friendſhip with the World, we are at <hi>Enmity with God, Jam.</hi> 4.4. But Regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion makes a great change, for it makes us Friends to God, and God carries himſelf Friendly towards us: The old Enmity is turned into a ſweet, real, and comfortable Friendſhip. God carries himſelf Friendly, and as a Cordial and great Friend to us, and ſo do we (in meaſure) unto him; we have his Heart opened to us in love and kindneſs, and ours are opened unto him in duty, love, and obedience. There is a great kindneſs, familiarity, and communication, between God and Regenerate perſons, and they do greatly delight in one anothers company, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 62.4. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 58. <hi>ult. Pro.</hi> 15.8. This Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip between God and New Creatures, is a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, not feigned Friendſhip; it is a heart-en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dearing, and Soul-knitting Friendſhip; it is a pleaſant and delightful Friendſhip; it is a ſure and well-grounded Friendſhip, and it is a conſtant and perpetual Friendſhip; it is ſuch a knitting and faſt Friendſhip, as that neither Sip or Satan can poſſibly deſolve. In, and ever after Regeneration, God calls his
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:44192:29"/>New Creatures his <hi>Friends, Luke</hi> 12.4. <hi>Joh.</hi> 15.13, 14. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 41.8. <hi>Jam.</hi> 2.23. and God and them declare themſelves true and choice Friends indeed to each other, by their love, and loving one another at all times, which is the property of a true Friend, <hi>Pro.</hi> 17.17.</p>
            <p>Seventhly and laſtly, They are by Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration put into <hi>a ſtate of Grace.</hi> By Nature men are not only ſinful, but they are in a ſtate of ſin and death; they are <hi>dead in ſin, and ſold under ſin;</hi> yea, they are <hi>altogether ſin, Eph.</hi> 2.1. <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.10-20. As their ſervices to God are, ſo are they; <hi>they are iniquity, Iſa.</hi> 1.13. It is their name, character, and nature, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.8. <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.15. But Regeneration ſets men in a ſtate of Grace; for although after Regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion they have much ſin and filthineſs in them, yet their ſtate is accounted and call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and it is really a holy ſtate; and after Regeneration, men are <hi>never accounted and call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſinners,</hi> but Saints, holy Brethren, the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and Children of God, and the like; for they have their new Names from their new States. As the Apoſtle ſpeaks to the <hi>Epheſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, Ye are</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>no more Strangers and Forreigners, but Fellow-Citizens of the Saints, Eph.</hi> 2.19. ſo it may be ſaid, and that truly, of all Regenerate perſons, that they are no more ſinners, (although they ſin) but <hi>holy and beloved, Col.</hi> 3.12. It is, and may be call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a ſtate of Grace, on many accounts; I'le name a few, and ſo diſmiſs this Head. (1.) Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are <hi>ingrafted into Christ,</hi> who is
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:44192:30"/>their <hi>Root, Revel.</hi> 22.16. the Stock and Vine in whom they are ſet by Regeneration, <hi>Job.</hi> 15.2.5. (2.) Becauſe they are in favour with God; he loves the New Creature with the love of complacency and delight, becauſe it is his very Image and Nature, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.4. <hi>Col.</hi> 3.10. and he hath great favour and kindneſs for them as ſuch, <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.4, 5. (3.) Becauſe they are under the Conduct and Power of Grace: For as before ſin reigned unto death, in, and over them; ſo now the <hi>Grace of Chriſt reigns through righteouſneſs unto Eternal Life, Rom.</hi> 5. <hi>ult.</hi> (4.) Becauſe of their Relation to God. They were the Children of the Devil, but now the Children of God: So their new Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation puts them into a new State. (5.) Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of their work and ſervice; their work was to <hi>ſerve ſin, Rom.</hi> 6. but now to ſerve God. It is now their only work and buſineſs to live unto God in all ſincere Goſpel-obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience. Holineſs is their Aim, Trade, and Principle; 'tis ſtated in their hearts, mould<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and framed there, and expreſſed in their endeavours. (6.) Becauſe they are in an abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and laſting ſtate; it is not tranſient, but their Regeneration ſhall be perfected in Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rification, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1 6. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.30. Thus you have heard what Regeneration is; I have o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened it as plainly as I can unto you, that you may underſtand it, and make a judgment of your own ſtates, whether you are indeed in a Regenerate ſtate and condition.</p>

               <head>CHAP. II. <hi>Shewing the abſolute neceſſity of Regeneration.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>Q. <hi>IS there an abſolute neceſſity of Regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Yea, there is an abſolute neceſſity of it: We have it from the Mouth of Chriſt himſelf in the <hi>Text,</hi> and verſe 5. <hi>Except a man be born again, he cannot ſee the Kingdom of God.</hi> And again, <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>erily, verily, I ſay unto you, except a man be born of Water, and of the Spirit, he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not enter into the Kingdom of God.</hi> And in verſ. 7. <hi>Marvel not that I ſaid unto you, you</hi> muſt <hi>be born again.</hi> And this great Truth is confirmed, as by the ſo often repeating, and reiterating of it, ſo likewiſe by no leſs than <hi>four Verities,</hi> or <hi>Aſſeverations.</hi> So that you ſee there is an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute neceſſity of it.</p>
               <p>But I ſhall not leave it ſo, but further prove and demonſtrate this great Truth, that ſo much, and ſo nearly concerns us all, by ſhewing 1. (The neceſſity of it) from <hi>the ends and uſes for which men were created, and are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generated.</hi> 2. <hi>From the utter inability and incapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city they are in,</hi> to obtain or proſecute thoſe holy Ends of God, whileſt in their unregene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate ſtates. Firſt, let us enquire into the ends and uſes of Gods Creations; his firſt and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Creating work. 1. Here. 2. Hereafter.</p>
               <p n="1">1 <hi>God created Man in his own Image, Gen.</hi> 1.26,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:44192:31"/>27. He was pleaſed to make us glorious and excellent Creatures indeed. <hi>God made man upright, Eccl.</hi> 7.29. he ſtampt the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of his own Wiſdom, Knowledge, Holineſs, and Righteouſneſs on us; he made us capable of knowing, truſting, loving, plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, and enjoying him for ever. God Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted us with pure and unſpotted Natures, with free and holy diſpoſitions and inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, with all abilities of will and power, to will and do that which was good and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing in his ſight; and as ſuch he delighted in us, and was refreſhed in our Communion with him, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.31. God looked on this No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Piece of his Workmanſhip, and tells us, it was <hi>very good;</hi> not only good, as his other works were ſaid to be, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.18.21. but (ſaith God) they are <hi>very good.</hi> Hence it is that they are ſaid to be <hi>Crown'd with Glory and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, Pſal.</hi> 8.4, 5. Now in alluſion and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity to this his firſt Creating of Man, (the Goſpel informs us) is his work in recreating or regenerating him: They <hi>are Gods workman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, created in Chriſt Jeſus unto good works,</hi> Eph. 2.10. <hi>renewed in knowledge, after the Image of him that created him, Col.</hi> 3.10. <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.24. <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified to the Lords uſe, and made partakers of the Divine Nature,</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.4. Thus the ſecond Greation, or Regeneration, anſwers to the firſt, is commenſurate to it, (although in ſome things, afterward to be ſpoken of, it exceeds it) and is the ſame with it in kind and degree, in likeneſs and reality.</p>
               <pb n="51" facs="tcp:44192:31"/>
               <p>Secondly, The ends of both theſe Creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are the ſame; namely, to <hi>glorifie God, and enjoy him for ever, Iſa.</hi> 43.21. <hi>This people have I formed for my ſelf, they ſhall ſhew forth my praiſe,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.15. <hi>That they which live ſhould not hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth live unto themſelves, but unto God,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.31. <hi>Whatever ye do, do all to the glory of God.</hi> And as to glorifie him, by living to him, ſo alſo to live with him, and enjoy him for ever, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 4.17. <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.24. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.1-6. But more particularly.</p>
               <p n="1">1 They were at firſt created in the Image of God, to hold forth the great and diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing goodneſs of God to them, beyond what it was to other Creatures; for the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency and Glory of their Make, and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, their ſtate and capacity, loudly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claims the Wiſdom, Power, Soveraignty, and Goodneſs of God to them. All Creatures were as Clay in the hand of the Potter, in his Eye and Hand, to make and form of it what manner of Creatures he pleaſed, But he was pleaſed to make and form Man <hi>of the dust of the ground,</hi> put a reaſonable Soul into him, and ſtamp his own Image of Knowledge, Righteouſneſs, and Holineſs upon him, that in this ſtate and condition he might com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend and ſhew forth the tranſcendent and glorious Excellency of the Maker. Thus Man is ſaid to be the <hi>Image and Glory of God,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.7. ſo in Regeneration God declares and holds forth his diſtinguiſhing Love, Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, Power, and Soveraign Grace, his Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:44192:32"/>and Righteouſneſs, by reſtoring them to their Primitive ſtate, and reſtamping his Image upon them, after they had wickedly and ſhamefully defaced, and utterly marr'd it, by their own wicked inventions, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 7. <hi>ult.</hi> and that when they were his vile and hateful Enemies, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.10. By this work of God on them whom he Regenerates, he holds forth his Soveraign <hi>Attributes,</hi> eſpecially his Soveraign <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Power, diſtinguiſhing Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and the exceeding riches of his Grace, Eph.</hi> 2.4, 5. <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.23, 24. <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.33. <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.19, 20. This is one of the glorious ends of God in Regenerating men.</p>
               <p n="2">2 That they might <hi>truſt</hi> in, and live upon him. This is a homage which all reaſonable Creatures do owe to their Soveraign Creator, namely, to truſt him with the keeping of themſelves, commit all to him, and relye upon him for all things, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4. <hi>ult.</hi> It was one of the Natural Laws that was concrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with them, and put into their hearts in their firſt make, to live always in a depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency on their Creator. For although God made Man a perfect Creature, filled him with his Grace, and adorned him with his Image, yet he was but a Creature, and he was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways to live and have his dependency on God for his ſubſiſtance, and not to ſtand and continue in that ſtate, from and by himſelf, but to depend wholly on him that made him. This he was bound to do, not only in point of prudence, for his own ſecurity and
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:44192:32"/>peace, but in point of duty, as that which he was indiſpenſably bound unto by the Law of his Creation. His neglect of his duty in this, occaſioned his Dreadful Fall, which ruined him, (I mean <hi>Adam</hi>) and all his Poſterity. The ſame end doth God Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate men for, namely, that they may believe in Jeſus Chriſt, and in God the Father by him, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.1. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.21. that they may truſt, commit themſelves to him, and live in a conſtant dependence on him, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 26.4. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 37.3.5. Therefore doth he infuſe his Faith into them, when he Regenerates them, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.12. and <hi>writes</hi> this Law in their hearts, that they may obey it, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.33. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.16.</p>
               <p n="3">3 They were at firſt Created <hi>to love God,</hi> with all their hearts, and chiefeſt, ſtrongeſt, and warmeſt love; that they might eſteem and love him as their higheſt and chiefeſt good, and ſingular Object of all their affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions. This Law of our Creation we have expreſt in <hi>Matth.</hi> 22.37. <hi>Thou ſhalt love the Lord thy God with all thy Heart, and with all thy Soul, and with all thy Mind.</hi> So likewiſe this is Gods End in his ſecond Creation, or Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration; and therefore doth he <hi>circumciſe their hearts to love him, Deut.</hi> 30.6. <hi>writes this Law in their hearts, and ſheds it abroad into them,</hi> in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.5. that they may love him aright, and that with his own love, without which they cannot do it.</p>
               <p n="4">4 The Lord Created Man <hi>to fear him, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence and ſtand in awe of him,</hi> as their great
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:44192:33"/>Soveraign Lord and King. This Law was created with them, and written in their hearts, until ſin had defaced and blotted it out. This Law is alſo written in the Bible, that men may remember what was written in their hearts in their Creation, and know their duty, and one of the ends for which they were Created, how they have loſt it, and to provoke them to endeavour the recovery of it. How often have we this Law expreſt in Scripture, <hi>Thou ſhalt fear the Lord thy God; thou ſhalt ſtand in awe, and ſin not, Deut.</hi> 6.13.24. <hi>Deut.</hi> 10.12.20. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2.11. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 4.4. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.17. It is a holy fear, not a perplexing and heart-diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieting fear that is commanded; it is a fear that is not an Adverſary to Faith and Love, as the forbidden fear is, but it is uſeful for us, and helpful to all other Graces. Now in Rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration God <hi>puts this fear into our hearts, Jer.</hi> 32.39, 40. that we may <hi>ſerve the Lord with reverence, and godly fear, Heb.</hi> 12.28. that we may not ſin, or depart from God, <hi>Jer.</hi> 32. <hi>I will put my fear into their hearts, and they ſhall not depart from me.</hi> But I muſt haſten.</p>
               <p n="5">5 God Created Man <hi>to obey him,</hi> and yield him free, loving, and chearful ſubjection and obedience. He formed them for his Subjects and Children, that they ſhould ſubject them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves unto his Laws and Authority, and yield or give to him the obedience of Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects to their Soveraign, and of Children to their Creator and Begetter; and accordingly they were Created with the Principle and
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:44192:33"/>Power of obedience; and to this Created Principle God preſently added a <hi>poſitive Law,</hi> to try and exerciſe their obedience unto God, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.16, 17. <hi>But of the Tree of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, thou ſhalt not eat of it, nor touch it.</hi> The Image of God, in which <hi>Adam,</hi> (and we in him) were Created, was ſuch, as fully ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled him and us, had we kept it, to have yielded all heart and practical obedience un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his whole will; he wanted nothing to help him, but he had all Grace in perfection to obey and conform to the whole Will of God, at all times: But Sin rooted the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple and Power of Heart-obedience quite out of us; ſo that men have now neither will nor power to obey the Will of God, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til they are regenerated by Grace. But that God might not looſe this End (altogether) for which he created Man, he is pleaſed, of his meer Grace, to Regenerate and renew ſome of Mankind, and thereby frame and mould them to ſuch obedience, as he at firſt intended them for; for men cannot, neither will they obey, until Grace hath reſtored this old Power and Principle of obedience which they had loſt. And therefore he Regenerates and infuſes this Power and Principle into men, to make them willing Subjects, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedient Children, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.14. <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.16, 17, 22. This was Gods End in ſending <hi>Paul</hi> to convert the <hi>Gentiles, Rom.</hi> 15.18. and this is powerfully effected in men, in and by the work of Regeneration.</p>
               <p n="6">
                  <pb n="56" facs="tcp:44192:34"/>6 That they might <hi>ſerve and worſhip him,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his revealed will. God made men to worſhip and ſerve him externally, as well as internally, by loving, fearing him, and the like. Chriſt mentions this in <hi>Matth.</hi> 4.10. when the Devil deſired external worſhip from him; <hi>It is written, thou ſhalt worſhip the Lord thy God.</hi> They were created in the Image of God, to ſerve him with fear, that is, to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2.11. <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.28. Now God Regenerates men, that they may by his Grace be enabled to do and perform that worſhip to him, which he at firſt created them for, and the Law of their Creation enjoyns them to; that is, to worſhip God in Spirit and Truth, for ſuch (Chriſt tells us) the <hi>Father ſeeks to worſhip him, John</hi> 4.23, 24. God works them for this ſelf-ſame thing, (though not only for it) ſays <hi>Paul,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.5. Regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion makes men, together with the help of the Spirit, worſhip God according to his own Will and appointment, ſpiritually, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lily, and acceptably through Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.28. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.5. <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.1. But aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuredly there are not any ſuch Worſhippers in the World, but Regenerate perſons; for all other men do what they do, in the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God, without the Grace and Spirit of God; and therefore cannot worſhip him in Spirit and Truth.</p>
               <p n="7">7 God created Man in his own Image, <hi>that they might know him;</hi> and therefore gave them a ſufficient light to ſee by, and eyes to uſe
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:44192:34"/>that light; revealed and made known himſelf unto them, that they might clearly ſee him, and always have him, and his Will in their eyes. The Image of God was Light and Knowledge, as well as Righteouſneſs and Holineſs; and therefore <hi>Adam</hi> knew, and ſaw God ſo far, as a Man was, or in that ſtate could be capable of knowing him; which as it aggravated his ſin, ſo it heightned his hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs while he kept it. The knowledge of God was abſolutely neceſſary to help him (and us in him) to truſt, love, fear, and obey him; ſo likewiſe to adore and admire him, and to worſhip and ſerve him as our God: But the knowledge of God being loſt, God hath provided means for the retriving of ſome, and bringing them to the knowledge of himſelf again; and this is done by Rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration. Hence they <hi>are renewed in knowledge after the Image of him that created them, Col.</hi> 3.10. <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. And <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>God that commanded light to ſhine out of darkneſs, hath ſhined in mens hearts, to give them the knowledge of the Glory of God in the Face of Chriſt,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.6. The ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of this knowledge, is <hi>Life Eternal, Joh.</hi> 17.3. For this end God opened <hi>Pauls</hi> eyes, <hi>Acts</hi> 22.14. and for this end he opens others eyes alſo; and until men are Regenerated, they are in darkneſs, and know not God, nor Chriſt the Mediator; and therefore regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates men, that they may know both, and whatever elſe is neceſſary to be known. Men are like <hi>Moles</hi> and <hi>Bruits</hi> without the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:44192:35"/>of God, Jeſus Chriſt, his Grace and Laws.</p>
               <p n="8">8 God Created Man, to make him the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of his Love, Delight, Complacency, and Communion; and therefore made him <hi>in his own likeneſs, Gen.</hi> 5.1. beautified him with his own Image and Nature, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.27. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.4. that thereby he might make him a lovely and ſuitable Object for thoſe ends. Man was the Flower, Crown, and Quinteſcence of the whole Creation, not ſo much becauſe he had a Reaſonable Soul, and a more Noble Nature, but <hi>becauſe he was created in the Image of God.</hi> God puts the <hi>Accent</hi> on that part of his Workmanſhip ſeveral times, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.26, 27.5. 1. <hi>Eccl.</hi> 7. <hi>ult.</hi> to which the Apoſtle alludes, <hi>Col.</hi> 3.10. This was the Creature that God ſaw <hi>very good,</hi> as fitted for theſe ends, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to be the objects of his love and delight, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.31. God made them after his own Heart, meet and anſwerable to his gracious purpoſes and intentions; but man quickly marr'd and diſrobed himſelf, and thereby made himſelf utterly uncapable and unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of Gods Delight, Complacency, and Communion; ſo that now God had not a Creature left in the World to delight in, and have Communion withal. But that he might not be altogether deſtitute of ſome to take up withal, he choſe a certain number, with a deſign to make them <hi>Veſſels of Honour,</hi> and to prepare them for this his ſpecial uſe, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to be his Companions, to ſolace himſelf
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:44192:35"/>with them, and rejoyce in them, as with his Friends and Lovers, <hi>Zeph.</hi> 3.17. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 63.3, 4. The Book of <hi>Canticles</hi> abundantly declares it. Now this he doth accompliſh in and upon them, in and by Regeneration, or making them New Creatures. By Regeneration, God in meaſure and degree, reſtores to them what they ſinfully loſt, by their Rebellion againſt, and Apoſtacy from God, and repoſes them with, and of his Grace and Nature, which they had deprived themſelves of; by which they loſt that love, delight, and complacency that God had to, and in them, and that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion he had with them whileſt they kept their integrity, and intended them for, in creating them. I ſay, God reſtores to them, and creates in them that which will for ever make them lovely and delightful unto him, by regenerating them; he <hi>puts his Grace and Spirit into them, Ezek.</hi> 36.25, 26, 27. ſtamps and impreſſes his own glorious Nature and Image on them, <hi>Col.</hi> 3.10. imputes the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of Chriſt to them, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. <hi>ult.</hi> and infuſes his Holineſs into the whole man, and ſo makes them lovely and beautiful, by the comelineſs that he hath of his own put upon them, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16.14. Then he loves and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights, then he takes complacency in them, and then he enters into, and holds communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with them with ſatisfaction, for his own Image and Grace ſake, as well as for his own love, and Sons ſake, <hi>Joh.</hi> 13.1. <hi>Pro.</hi> 8.17. <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.21.23. <hi>Pro.</hi> 15.8. <hi>Zeph.</hi> 3.17. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 63.3, 4.
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:44192:36"/>1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.3. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.9. Theſe are ſome, but not all the Ends of God in regenerating men, which muſt be obtained in this world. But beſides theſe that concern this life, there are others that concern Chriſt his coming, and the Eternal ſtates of Gods Elect. A word of theſe, and I have done with this.</p>
               <p n="1">1 The <hi>Elect are the Spouſes</hi> of Chriſt, by Chriſts Purchaſe, and Gods Gift to him, they were given to him, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.37. <hi>Joh.</hi> 10.29. that he might Marry them, and take them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Conjugal Relation (as you have heard before) in purſuance of Gods Ends in giving them to Chriſt, he pays a price for them, and purchaſes them for himſelf; (for although they are ſaid to be given to Chriſt, yet he could not get them out of Priſon, but by paying their debts, and full ranſom, which Divine Juſtice demanded, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.20.) and then comes and requires his own, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts, and takes them to himſelf; and by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generating them, he ſhews himſelf unto them, and acquaints them with himſelf, perſwades them to conſent to his Propoſals, and chuſe him for their Husband; and ſo by his Grace in their hearts, they freely, willingly, and chearfully give their conſent, and Chriſt and they do mutually give themſelves to each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and take each other into a Matrimonial ſtate and reſolution. This cannot be done without Regeneration; for men are not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorn'd with a perſonal lovelineſs, and made meet for Chriſt, until they are made <hi>parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:44192:36"/>of the Divine Nature,</hi> and are beautified with his Image, which makes them meet Companions for him: So they will by no means be perſwaded to conſent to have him for their Head and Husband, and reſign up themſelves unto him, until they have their hearts and ſtates changed, by his Spirit and Grace, in Regeneration. And therefore, I ſay, that Regeneration is abſolutely neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to bring perſons into a Conjugal Relation to Chriſt.</p>
               <p>But yet there is more to be done than what I have yet ſaid, and which I aim at in what I have ſpoken, namely, that the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted Bride <hi>is to make her ſelf ready for the great Marriage day,</hi> or for the compleatment of the Marriage Solemnities, which ſhall be at Chriſt his ſecond Perſonal coming, when he ſhall receive his Bride unto himſelf, and carry her home to his own Royal Palace in State and Glory, <hi>John</hi> 14.3. <hi>Revel.</hi> 19.1-8. <hi>Matth.</hi> 25.31, 32. For this day, and the great Solemnity of it, Chriſt muſt have his Bride in a <hi>state and practical readineſs,</hi> to meet her Bridegroom in the Clouds, where he will come with his Attendants in great State, and ſend his Angels for his <hi>Bride</hi> to come to him; where he will wait to receive and imbrace her, and then will the Lord <hi>make his great Feast,</hi> called the <hi>Supper of the Lamb, and a Feaſt of fat things;</hi> to which Feaſt and Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age ſhe muſt come ready deckt, with all her Ornaments and Wedding Garments, that ſhe
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:44192:37"/>may be ſuitable unto her Husband. For what hath been ſaid, ſee theſe Scriptures, <hi>Matth.</hi> 25.32, 33, 34. 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 4.16, 17. <hi>Rev.</hi> 19.9.17. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 25.6. Now, I ſay, the Lord Jeſus ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horts her, or them, to get and make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ready for his coming, <hi>Matth.</hi> 24.44. <hi>Luke</hi> 12.35, 36. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.11, 12. <hi>Matth.</hi> 25.10, 11, 12, 13, 14. that he may praiſe and commend her, bleſs and reward her, <hi>Revel.</hi> 19.7. <hi>Matth.</hi> 24.46.</p>
               <p>Now this cannot be done without Rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, for that is their Ornament, Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, Honour, and Glory. Without Regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion they are not fit for Contraction, much leſs can they make themſelves ready for the great Wedding day, and the glorious Solem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and ſtate thereof. The Lord Jeſus will have but uncomely, black, and dirty Spouſes of us, without Regeneration, notwithſtanding our Election.</p>
               <p n="2">2 <hi>Full and everlaſting fruition of, and Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with the great and holy God.</hi> This is the promiſed and deſigned ſtate and portion of all Gods Elect number, and this they are and ſhall be fitted for by Regeneration. Election is the deſigning and appointing us to that happineſs; Regeneration is the preparing and meeting us for the enjoyment of it. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection is the cauſes or Spring of Regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and Regeneration is the fruit of Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; but the fruition and eternal enjoyment of God in Heaven, is the end of both. Men are no more capable of living in the preſence
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:44192:37"/>and enjoyment of God, in their ſtate of ſin, than <hi>Swine</hi> are to live in a Kings Palace, or Earthly Bodies in the Sun. Regenerate per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons <hi>ſhall meet the Lord in the Air, and for ever be with him,</hi> 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 4.17. They <hi>ſhall ſee him as he is,</hi> 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.2. and <hi>face to face,</hi> as <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.12. and they ſhall live with Chriſt for evermore, in perfect holineſs, joy, and glory, <hi>Matth.</hi> 25. <hi>ult.</hi> But this men can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not do nor obtain without Regeneration. (1.) Becauſe of the unſuitableneſs of unrege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate mens hearts, unto ſo glorious a ſtate of holineſs, honour, and dignity. (2.) Becauſe God is a holy God. He is glorious in Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, yea, Holineſs its ſelf, and no uncircum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed heart can be admitted into his preſence, and men in their unchanged ſtates are an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bomination unto him, who is the Fountain of Holineſs. (3.) Becauſe it is Gods own Ordinance, which ſhall ſtand faſt to all Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations, namely, that Regeneration ſhall precede and prepare the way to Glory, and the everlaſting fruition and enjoyment of God, <hi>John</hi> 3.3.5.7. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.29, 30. It is Gods filed, ſtated way with men, that they muſt have their fruit unto holineſs here, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they can enjoy Communion in Heaven with him hereafter; and it is Regeneration that puts men into a ſtate of holineſs here, to qualifie and prepare them for Eternal Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and Communion with the Father and Son in another World.</p>
               <p>Thus I have preſented you with the firſt
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:44192:38"/>grand reaſon or ground of the neceſſity of Regeneration, namely, the uſes and ends God deſigns men to in their firſt and ſecond Creation. Now in the ſecond place, I am to ſhew you the neceſſity of Regeneration, from the ſtate whereinto Sin hath plunged us, or by ſhewing our weakneſs, wilfulneſs, averſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and utter inability, to obtain and proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute thoſe holy Ends of God without Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation. Both Scripture and Experience will afford us ſufficient proofs of this.</p>
               <p>Firſt then, we are in <hi>groſs and palpable dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> (as hath been ſhewed) we are in our ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſtate, not only in the dark, but <hi>we are in darkneſs, Eph.</hi> 5.8. This is called <hi>groſs dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> to ſhew that it is exceeding great, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 60.2. yea, it is ſaid, that we are <hi>full of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> and <hi>in great darkneſs, Matth.</hi> 6.23. And the god of this World (is ſaid) to bring us into, and keep us in it, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.4. It is ſuch a darkneſs and blindneſs, as that men know not where they are, what they are, nor where they are going. How then can they anſwer or proſecute Gods Ends, in Creating them in his own Image, without Regeneration; and therefore they ſtand in abſolute need of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation, to make them <hi>Children of Light, Eph.</hi> 5.8. ſuch as the Apoſtle tells us the <hi>Theſſalonians</hi> were by Regeneration, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.5. Men are commanded to <hi>walk as Children of Light,</hi> 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.8. which Regenerating Light enables them to do. It is only Regenerating Light and Knowledge that ſhews men the
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:44192:38"/>way wherein they ſhould walk, and the things that they ſhould believe and do, in order to Eternal Happineſs, and without which they ſtumble, fall, and periſh.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Let us take a further view of the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the utter incapacity we are in by Nature, to anſwer or reach the ends of our firſt Creation, and the ends and uſes which God deſigned us to, in forming and making us <hi>in his own Image and Likeneſs,</hi> that thereby we may ſee the neceſſity of Regeneration, for the reſtoring us (in meaſure) to our <hi>Primitive ſtate,</hi> and capacitating us to attain thoſe ends, and ſerve his deſigns, which we are, on many accounts, indiſpenſably bound to do. I ſhall therefore preſent your unregenerate condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion unto you, for your conviction and quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, yet further; and that with all poſſible brevity. 2. We are by ſin <hi>fallen from God,</hi> and become real ſtrangers to him; we have loſt him in the Fogs of Luſts and Blindneſs. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſince we were caſt out of <hi>Paradiſe</hi> for ſin, we have been wandring in the Wilderneſs and howling Deſarts, and are <hi>Strangers and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigners</hi> to God, and our ſelves, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.12.19. and alſo to all happineſs, and true bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
               <p n="3">3 By Nature we are <hi>averſe, and unwilling to know our ſtates, ſins, and wickedneſs,</hi> our mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery and wretchedneſs, and the right way to obtain deliverance from, and out of them; as alſo to know Chriſt, and true Holineſs, and moſt of all, to cloſe, comply, and joyn Iſſues with God in his own way for our Salvation.
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:44192:39"/>For although we are exceeding ſinful and wretched, and God hath told us ſo plainly and particularly, and hath alſo ſhewed us the way to eſcape, held out the <hi>Golden Scepter</hi> to us, and proffered us his Hand to help us out, yet we ſhut our eyes, and ſtop our ears againſt him, and his favours, and refuſe to accept his kindneſs and gracious proffers, until Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation changes us, and gives us new Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, <hi>Matth.</hi> 23.37. <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.4. <hi>Pro.</hi> 1.24. <hi>ult.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4 By Nature <hi>we are most vile, filthy, abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and loathſome Creatures,</hi> laden with ſins, lying in our blood unwaſhed, full of all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Leprous ſpots, and accurſed Plague<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſores; hateful and contemptible; compared to <hi>Dogs, Swine, Serpents, Vipers,</hi> and <hi>Adders.</hi> Oh how doth the Holy Ghoſt in Scripture ſet us out, and decipher us? <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.10-20. <hi>Tit.</hi> 1. <hi>ult. Rev.</hi> 3.17. <hi>Rev.</hi> 22.11.13. <hi>Matth.</hi> 23.33. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16.2-11. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1. <hi>Matth.</hi> 7.6. <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. with innumerable other like them.</p>
               <p n="5">5 By Nature <hi>we are without ſtrength;</hi> we are as weak as water; we are ſo impotent, as that we cannot help our ſelves, nor do any thing aright that God commands; for by ſin we loſt all our ſpiritual ſtrength and ability to do good, or obey any Command of God. By ſin we depraved and deprived our ſelves of Light, Life, Holineſs, Strength, and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever was created with, or given to us, in our Creation and firſt make, all is demoliſhed and ruined, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.6. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.3. Therefore in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation men receive new ſtrength and power from God to obey, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.13.</p>

                  <pb n="67" facs="tcp:44192:39"/>6 By Nature <hi>we are Servants to the Devil, and our own Luſts, Rebels and Enemies to and againſt God</hi> (as was ſhewed before.) We have choſen the ſervice of Luſts and Satan, and are well pleaſed and contented with it, do it moſt willingly and readily, and are not weary of it; but againſt God <hi>we lift up the heel, and kick,</hi> throw off his Yoke, and reject his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority over us, in his Laws and Statutes, <hi>Joh.</hi> 8.44. <hi>Deut.</hi> 32. <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.2. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2. <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.</p>
               <p n="7">7 By Nature <hi>we are lovers of ſin, and haters of God,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.4. <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.30. We ſin upon choice, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 66.3. and are greatly delighted with it, <hi>Pro.</hi> 2.14. As the Law of God is to Believers, namely, their <hi>joy and delight, Rom.</hi> 7.22. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 1.2. ſo is ſin and wickedneſs to Unbelievers, whileſt ſuch; they rejoyce not only to be evil, but alſo to do it, and to work it, or in it, <hi>with both hands, Jer.</hi> 11.15.

               <p n="8">8 By Nature <hi>we are dead in ſins and treſpaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, Eph.</hi> 2.1.5. and live ſtinking above ground, like filthy Carrion.

God hath appointed <hi>Faith in Chriſt, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance towards God, Acts</hi> 20.21. and <hi>Goſpel-Holineſs,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:44192:40"/>Rom.</hi> 6.22. <hi>Heb.</hi> 14.14. to be the way to happineſs; but men will rather loſe their happineſs, than have it in theſe ways of Gods own appointment: They will have God to bow and condeſcend to them, but they will not bend to, nor comply with the will and way of God; ſo that if God will ſave them, it muſt be on their own terms, not Gods; for they do by no means like or deſire to win Heaven by Self-denial, Faith, Repentance, true Holineſs, and Goſpel-obedience, but in the way of <hi>their own hearts, Eccl.</hi> 11.9. The way of Gods preſcribing is contrary to their Luſts, Humours, Inclinations, Intereſts, and Affections. Happineſs they would have, but with all theſe. They do not account their obtainment of happineſs, of that weight and moment, as to deny themſelves of theſe to get it. All the Moral perſwaſions in the World will not make them change their minds; but that they may be happy on other and eaſier terms than, God propounds unto them. In <hi>Job</hi> 21.14. there is this deſcription given of us, as in our Natural ſtates; <hi>They ſay to God, depart from us, for we deſire not the knowledge of thy ways;</hi> that is, the ways of God, which are appointed by God to lead and conduct men to Eternal Happineſs. Now if men do not ſo much as deſire happineſs, much leſs will or can they ſeriouſly ſeek it in the Lords way; without which, yea, and alſo ſtriving for it, men ſhall <hi>not find, nor obtain it, Luke</hi> 13.24. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.24. Thus we may ſee (by theſe few things) the neceſſity of Rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:44192:41"/>from the ſtate and condition we are all in by Nature. I have ſaid but little of what I could ſay of this matter; but I think I have ſaid enough to evince and prove the abſolute neceſſity of a new ſtate, by what hath been ſaid of our old; how unable and unca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable we are to anſwer, cloſe up with, proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute and obtain the ends of God in our firſt Make, or his knowing us in his own Image and Likeneſs, without Regeneration. How utterly unable we are to ſerve his holy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns, without his ſpecial Grace, renewing and new moulding us for his own glorious ends and purpoſes, which is done by Rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>What have you elſe to offer for the further demonſtrating and proving this great Truth, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the abſolute neceſſity of Regeneration, for our fuller information and conviction: for it is a hard matter to believe it, and there are but few that do believe what you have already ſaid; yea, there are many that preach quite contrary Doctrine, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade men that they are Regenerated, in, and by their Water Baptiſm; and therefore they need no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Regeneration?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> I ſhall therefore further prove and demonſtrate this Truth to you, and ſhew you the abſolute neceſſity of it, in theſe follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing particulars.</p>
               <p n="1">1 No man can <hi>know Jeſus Chriſt rightly and ſavingly,</hi> without Regeneration; therefore Regeneration is abſolutely neceſſary for the right knowledge, or of knowing Chriſt, which is <hi>Life Eternal, Joh.</hi> 17.3. And that we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:44192:41"/>ſo know him until we are Regenerated, hath been already proved: For we are <hi>dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Eph.</hi> 5.8. and <hi>walk in darkneſs, becauſe darkneſs hath blinded our eyes,</hi> 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.11.</p>
               <p n="2">2 No man can <hi>rightly believe in Chriſt, and in God the Father,</hi> without Regeneration; and therefore it is abſolutely needful, It is abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely neceſſary to Salvation that we do right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly believe, becauſe it is Gods Statute Law, that <hi>ſuch as do not ſo believe, ſhall not ſee life, but the wrath of God abideth on them, Joh.</hi> 3.36. Now that none believe in Chriſt unto Salvation, is evident, becauſe our ſin and Gods Curſe hath <hi>concluded,</hi> or (<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>) <hi>ſhut up all in unbelief,</hi> and believing is of <hi>Grace, Act.</hi> 1.18.2.1.</p>
               <p n="3">3 No man can <hi>rightly repent of his ſins</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Regeneration; therefore it is abſolutely neceſſary for Repentance. Now true Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance is abſolutely neceſſary to Salvation; for God hath determined, that <hi>except we repent, we ſhall all periſh, Luke</hi> 13.3.5. and that none can truly and ſavingly repent without the Grace of God in Regeneration, is evident, becauſe the Scripture ſaith, <hi>We are under hardneſs of heart,</hi> in our unregenerate ſtates, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 3.7. <hi>Mark</hi> 3.5. <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.5. <hi>Matth.</hi> 19.8. And alſo becauſe <hi>Repentance unto Life, is the ſpecial gift of God, Acts</hi> 5.31. <hi>Acts</hi> 11.18.</p>
               <p n="4">4 No man can <hi>deny himſelf aright,</hi> for Chriſt, Grace, and Holineſs, without Regeneration; therefore it is abſolutely neceſſary for Self-denial. Now Self-denial is abſolutely neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to Salvation, and in order thereunto, of <hi>being Chriſts Diſciples, Luke</hi> 14.26. <hi>Mark</hi> 8.34.
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:44192:42"/>And that Regeneration is as neceſſary to Self-denial, appears thus; becauſe men have much more content and ſatisfaction in what they ſhould forgo and part withal, than in Chriſt, Holineſs, and Salvation, which they muſt ſell, or leave for the obtainment of; and they ſeem to ſee a greater happineſs in keeping their Luſts, Righteouſneſs, Eaſe, and Intereſts, than in all that they may gain by exchanging what they have in poſſeſſion, for that which is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered them; and who will part with a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and ſeemingly greater good, for that which they account more uncertain, and of leſſer value? Thus is their caſe, and thus do they abſurdly (in this matter) reaſon, as you may read <hi>Luke,</hi> 18.22, 23. <hi>Luke</hi> 14.17-21. Men will never learn, neither can they freely pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe the Doctrine and Duty of abſolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary Self-denial, until the Grace of God in Regeneration hath wrought them for it.</p>
               <p n="5">5 No man can <hi>really mortifie his luſts</hi> without Regeneration; therefore it is abſolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary. Now this muſt be done by God and us, or we ſhall be everlaſtingly undone, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.13. <hi>Col.</hi> 3.5. <hi>Micah</hi> 7.18, 19. And that we cannot, will not do it, until we are New Creatures, is clear; for till then we are in love and league with them, make proviſion for them, as for <hi>Friends and Lovers,</hi> and have nothing, no Principle of Grace and Power, to do ſuch a work withal; and will want a will to will it, an eye to ſee, and a hand to take hold of, and uſe the Sword that muſt do it, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.4. <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. <hi>ult.</hi> 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.7.</p>
               <p n="6">
                  <pb n="73" facs="tcp:44192:42"/>6 No man can <hi>love God aright</hi> without Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation; therefore it is abſolutely neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. It is abſolutely needful that <hi>we love the Lord Jeſus in ſincerity,</hi> as we would avoid the great Curſes, <hi>Eph.</hi> 6. <hi>ult.</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16.22. and this is done by the <hi>love of God ſhed abroad in our hearts</hi> in Regeneration, <hi>Deut.</hi> 30.6. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.5. with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which we cannot ſo love him; for we have no ſuch love in our hearts before Rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, but are ſwallowed up in, and with Self-love, with the entire love of our Luſts, Profits, Pleaſures, and Carnal Delights.</p>
               <p n="7">7. No man can <hi>be united to, and made one with Chriſt,</hi> without Regeneration. We are not tranſplanted out of the old <hi>Adams</hi> Stock into Chriſt, the Heavenly Stock, without Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation, but in and by it we are. We are not born (at firſt) living Members of his Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, but are made ſuch by Regeneration, (as was ſhewed.) This alſo is abſolutely neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to Salvation: For all Profeſſors of Chriſt, that hang about him only, and are not graft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into him, ſhall be caſt into Hell Fire, <hi>Joh.</hi> 15.6. <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.6, 7.</p>
               <p n="8">8 No man can <hi>make God his only truſt, and live in a continual dependence on him,</hi> without Rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration. This we are all bound to do, at all times, in all ſtates and conditions, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 62.8. <hi>Pro.</hi> 3.5. but we cannot do it without the great change; for we have not the Grace to do it withal, until the Holy Ghoſt convey it into us, by Regenerating us: Till then our Stays are broken Reeds, and on the broken Staff of <hi>Egypt</hi> do we reſt our ſelves; there
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:44192:43"/>do we repoſe our ſelves, and from them do we expect protection, aid, and ſuccour; but we look not to, nor relye upon the Holy One of <hi>Iſrael</hi> in truth, but caſt him out of our conſideration.</p>
               <p n="9">9 No man can <hi>pray or worſhip God in a right manner,</hi> without Regeneration; therefore it is abſolutely neceſſary. Until men are Rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated, they have neither the grace nor ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Prayer; and therefore cannot poſſibly pray according to the Will of God, nor per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form any part of Divine Worſhip, ſo as to pleaſe God, and be accepted of him. God gives men his Spirit of Grace, and the Grace of the Spirit in Regeneration, to enable them to worſhip him ſpiritually and rightly, ſo as to pleaſe and honour him; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they cannot ſo worſhip God, before they are Regenerate, <hi>Zach.</hi> 12.10. <hi>Joh.</hi> 16.7, 8. <hi>Acts</hi> 9. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.26, 27.</p>
               <p n="10">10 No man can <hi>obey God, or ſerve him with Goſpel filial obedience,</hi> without he be Regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; therefore Regeneration is abſolutely neceſſary to make us obedient to the Will of God. Men without Regenerating Grace may do what God Commands, and the matter of Duty, but they cannot do it dutifully, with Heart-ſubjection to the Will of God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he hath ſo commanded; for they are <hi>ſervants to Sin, and obey their Luſts, and the Devil, Rom.</hi> 6.16, 17. <hi>Joh.</hi> 8.44. It is Regeneration that conforms the whole man to the Will of God, and makes them real obedient Servants and Children, and nothing leſs will do it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.18.</p>
               <p n="11">
                  <pb n="75" facs="tcp:44192:43"/>11 No man can <hi>be related to Christ in any ſpecial or peculiar Relation.</hi> No man can be the <hi>Child</hi> of God, or <hi>Spouſe</hi> of Chriſt, without Regeneration; and then they cannot be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedient Children, nor Spouſes, as they muſt be, if ever ſaved, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.14. It is Regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that begets men to God, and raiſes up, or brings forth Children for him, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.3.14. It is Regeneration that diſpoſes men for, and <hi>Marries them to Chriſt,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.2. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they are not, neither may they claim the names or priviledges of Gods Children, or Chriſts Spouſes, until they are Regenerated and born again; they are neither adopted Children, nor contracted Spouſes, until Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation.</p>
               <p n="12">12 No man can <hi>have dominion over all his luſts</hi> without Regeneration, neither can they curb and keep them under, until they are Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate; their Luſts have <hi>dominion over them,</hi> and <hi>they ſerve and obey them, Eph.</hi> 2.3. <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.16, 17. But ever after Regeneration, they have dominion over their luſts, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.14. They are enabled by Regeneration to Reign over, and trample on the Necks of thoſe E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies that had dominion over them all the days of their unregeneracy.</p>
               <p n="13">13 No man can <hi>live to God, and make it his whole buſineſs and endeavour ſo to do,</hi> until they are Regenerated. This is done by Grace af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Regeneration, but never before; for all men have loſt their will and power to do it, which is reſtored to them in Regeneration, (as was ſhewed.) The great end of Man was to
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:44192:44"/>live to, and walk with God, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.15. <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.4. but men in their old ſtate do devote themſelves to live wholly and only to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and not at all to God.</p>
               <p n="14">14 No man can <hi>be made free of the Heavenly City, and Spiritual Corporation, nor be ſet at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty from bondage and thraldome,</hi> but in and by Regeneration. All men are (by Nature) in bondage to the Devil and Luſts, (as you heard before) but Regeneration is the year or day of Releaſe and Enlargement to impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned Souls; for then comes Jeſus Chriſt, opens the Priſon doors, and brings out his <hi>Priſoners, Joh.</hi> 8.36. <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.1.13. until then they lye in the <hi>Dungeon</hi> of darkneſs, bound hand and foot with Fetters of Iron, and ſhut in, under <hi>Impenitency, Ignorance,</hi> and <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbelief,</hi> and cannot get forth, until the <hi>Jubilee</hi> comes and proclaims Liberty to them, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 61.1, 2. <hi>Zach.</hi> 2.11. Then are they made Free Citizens of the <hi>New Jeruſalem,</hi> and have their Freedom given them, to live and Trade in Heaven for heavenly and everlaſting Commodities, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.19. <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.20. Behold the neceſſity then of Regeneration.</p>
               <p n="15">15 No man can <hi>be actually and perſonally ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified, pardoned, and acquitted,</hi> without Rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, but are held under the Guilt and Curſe of the Law; for they muſt firſt believe unto Juſtification of life, before they can obtain a diſcharge, and take out an Acquit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance under the Hand and Seal of the Holy Ghoſt, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.13. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.18. but this they cannot do, for want of Faith, until they are
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:44192:44"/>Regenerated, and thereby made partakers of this glorious Grace.</p>
               <p n="16">16 No man can <hi>fear God aright,</hi> namely, <hi>with a godly filial fear,</hi> nor indeed can he ſtand in awe of God, and ſin not, <hi>or walk in the fear of God all the day long, as commanded, Pro.</hi> 23.17. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 4.4. until they be Regenerated; for who can ſo fear and reverence God, until God put it <hi>into his heart to do it, Jer.</hi> 32.39, 40. for if they could, and had they where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withal to do it without this Grace of God, to what purpoſe hath God promiſed to do it himſelf, and declared it to be a choiſe and ſingular Gift and Grace of his own giving and working in their hearts? <hi>I will</hi> (ſays God) <hi>put my fear into their hearts, that they may not depart from me, and that they may fear me for ever.</hi> And how can men fear God with a filial or Child-like fear, until they are made Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren by Regeneration, and <hi>begotten again</hi> by his Word and Spirit, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.3. <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.18. <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.5.</p>
               <p n="17">17 No man can <hi>make the Glory of God his greateſt end and aim, and really deſign to pleaſe and honour God, in his words and deeds,</hi> without Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation; therefore it is abſolutely neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary. We are indiſpenſably bound to make God the chief and great aim and end of all our undertakings, and to ſeek, deſign, and endeavour with all poſſible ſeriouſneſs and diligence, to pleaſe, honour, and exalt him, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.31. <hi>Col.</hi> 3.23. <hi>Pro.</hi> 3.9. <hi>Col.</hi> 1.10. 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 4.1. But this we cannot do, until a new Spring of Life, and Divine Principles be
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:44192:45"/>put into us by Regeneration; for we are by Nature wholly ſelfiſh, are quite ſwallowed up in ſinful carnal ſelf; Self is the principle, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, and end of all our thoughts, words, and deeds; Self-pleaſure, profit, eaſe, honour, and ſecurity, have only Self in the bottom and top of every Good, as well as Evil, in Religious, as well as Civil works: And how can it be otherwiſe with us, the Fountain of our Natures being ſo miſerably corrupted and depraved as it is? And it is a truth, that the Streams cannot riſe higher than the Fountains from whence they come.</p>
               <p n="18">18 No man can <hi>be the object of Gods delight and complacency, until he be Regenerated,</hi> becauſe they have nothing that is lovely and deſirable in them. Before Regeneration men are hateful, vile, and abominable in the ſight of God, (as hath been ſhewed) as they are ſinners, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waſhed. It is the <hi>Nature and Image</hi> of God, that is the <hi>Object</hi> of Gods delight and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placency in men; for the God of Holineſs <hi>cannot look on iniquity, he is of purer eyes than to do ſo, Habuk.</hi> 1.13. and this Nature and Image we have not, until we are Regenerated, and made New Creatures by Grace; for till then; God looks on us as in our <hi>blood, Ezek.</hi> 16. <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.9, 10, 11. and ſtamps his own Nature and Image on us, to make us clean, pure, lovely, and delightful in his eyes. He beautifies men with his Ornaments, that he may take pleaſure in, and rejoyce with them, <hi>Zach.</hi> 3.17.</p>
               <p n="19">19 No man can <hi>claim a Right unto, and Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:44192:45"/>in the Covenant and Promiſes,</hi> without Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation; for they are not under, neither have they any intereſt in them, whileſt they lay in their blood, and continue in their ſtate of Enmity againſt God. No man can be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſted in the Promiſes and Covenant of Grace and Life, that is not intereſted in Chriſt, and no man is intereſted in Chriſt, until he be a New Creature. <hi>All the Promiſes are in Christ,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.20. and they are made ours by vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of our having of, and being in Chriſt; and when we are in Chriſt, <hi>all is ours,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.21, 22, 23. and not till then; then we may claim and uſe them as ours, but not till then.</p>
               <p n="20">20 No man can <hi>be in a ſtate of Grace and Life, without Regeneration;</hi> no man can be a ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, gracious, and good man, until he be Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generated. Whatever good things he may have, act, and do, yet he is in a ſtate of ſin and death ſtill, until he paſs under Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.

               <p>But I ſee I muſt contract my ſelf, leſt I run beyond my intentions; and therefore ſhall briefly ſum up what I have further to ſay on this Head, that I may preſently diſmiſs it. Therefore, I ſay, that as we ſtand in abſolute need of Regeneration, for the Reaſons and Ends already named, ſo likewiſe for thoſe
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:44192:46"/>that follow, which I ſhall but name. We cannot <hi>take up in God as in our portion, ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and only happineſs,</hi> without Regeneration, neither can we <hi>chuſe him</hi> for the great and on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly delight of our Souls, without it. We cannot <hi>have our wills bowed to, and ſwallowed up into the Will of God,</hi> nor freely, chearfully, and dutifully yield up our ſelves to his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoſement, without Regeneration. We can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not <hi>rejoyce in Christ Jeſus,</hi> nor in tribulation and bearing the Croſs, nor yet in doing good, and working Righteouſneſs, without Rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration. We cannot <hi>be dutifully and thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully patient under,</hi> and contented with an af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted ſtate and condition, nor demean and carry our ſelves well in it, without Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. We cannot <hi>be fruitful in every good work,</hi> nor bear fruit unto Eternal Life, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Regeneration. We cannot <hi>highly eſteem, and ſet a due, nor a right value</hi> on Chriſt his Perſon, Blood, Laws, and Grace, nor on the great love and kindneſs of God, but ſlight and diſeſteem all, without Regeneration. Without Regeneration we cannot <hi>willingly be nothing, that Chriſt may be all in all,</hi> nor be laid in the duſt and debaſed, that he may be mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified and exalted, nor ſuffer diminution to greaten him. We cannot <hi>walk uprightly with God,</hi> nor (indeed) <hi>ſet our affections on things a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove,</hi> as we are indiſpenſably bound to do, without Regeneration. We cannot <hi>walk hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly with God, nor be adorned and cloathed with Humility,</hi> be meek, and of poor and contrite ſpirits, without Regeneration. Without Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:44192:46"/>
                  <hi>we cannot</hi> (ought not) <hi>be Church-members, nor rightly participate of the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per:</hi> For theſe great and diſtinguiſhing Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges belong to, and were appointed only for New Creatures. In a word, we cannot <hi>be ſaved, nor walk in the right way to Heaven, nor have Communion with God here,</hi> or hereafter, without Regeneration.</p>
               <p>And therefore Regeneration is abſolutely needful for theſe, all theſe, and ſeveral other ends and purpoſes. It is abſolutely neceſſary that we be ſaved from wrath to come, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtated in Eternal Glory; and that in order thereunto we be Regenerated, and made new Creatures. That we be ſuch indeed, and ſo do and walk, as hath been ſaid, in order to our glorifying of God here, and Eternal Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation hereafter, which we cannot be, do, nor obtain, but in and by Regeneration; but in and by Regeneration we may and ſhall, and that becauſe God hath ſo appointed and promiſed it. It is Gods fixed, ſtated way, and it ſhall ſtand inviolably; namely, that he will ſave men in and by Regeneration; and that ſuch as are Regenerated ſhall be ſaved, and ſuch as are not, ſhall moſt certainly be dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Therefore let no man flatter himſelf with vain hopes of ever getting to Heaven in any other way;</hi> for the purpoſes and Ordinances of God <hi>ſhall ſtand to all Generations, and he will do all his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, Iſa.</hi> 46.10, 11. <hi>He hath ſaid it, and ſhall he not do it?</hi> Who can turn his hand, or alter his mind? and who durſt ſay it ſhall not be

               <p>Q. <hi>ARe there any lets, hinderances, or obstructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in the way of Regeneration, to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pede and hinder it?</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> There are very many and great obſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions in the way of Gods Regenerating men; inſomuch, as that it is a wonder that any are Regenerated. God met with no lets or hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drances in his firſt Creating of us, but in his remaking us, he meets with many. He made us reaſonable Creatures without oppoſition, but when he comes to make us New Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, he finds nothing elſe but impediments, contradiction, and fightings againſt him. Hence 'tis ſaid, <hi>Gen.</hi> 6.3. <hi>His ſpirit ſhall not always strive with man:</hi> And <hi>how often would I have gathered you, but ye would not, Matth.</hi> 23.37. And Chriſt tells the Jews, that <hi>they would not come to him, Joh.</hi> 8.40. though <hi>he had all the day long ſtretched out his hand to them, Rom.</hi> 10. <hi>ult.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Q. <hi>What are thoſe contradictions, hinderances, and oppoſitions, the work of Regeneration meets withal, to impede and obstruct it, and from whom are they, or from whom do they ariſe?</hi>

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> men by Nature; in Profeſſors of the Name
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:44192:48"/>Truths, and good ways of God; as well as in profeſſed <hi>Turks and Heathens,</hi> as is ſhewed in the ſaid Scriptures: And the infidelity of mens hearts is ſuch, as that they will not believe that they do really ſtand in need of Regeneration; even thoſe men who profeſs to believe there is a God, that he ſees and takes notice of their ſtates and ways, that the Scriptures of God are true, that God rules in and governs the World, and that he hath puniſhments for the unjuſt, and will recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence their way on their heads, and <hi>render to every man according to his works, Rom.</hi> 2.6. I fay, thoſe men that do ſo believe, do not ſee and believe <hi>indeed</hi> their own preſent ſtates, and their own neceſſity of Regeneration, but flatter themſelves in the vain and groundleſs imaginations of their own hearts, that if they mend their ways, reform without, and turn from vicious courſes and practiſes, to the eternal practiſe of Vertue, that in ſo doing they may obtain happineſs, and do well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough hereafter, although they ſtick there, and never are Regenerated. Hence it is that they conclude, that 'tis in vain, and a kind of ſuperſtition in them, to trouble and concern themſelves to look any further, or ſeek after a change of heart and ſtate, but reſolve they will not do ſo, whatever is ſaid to confute and convince them of their errour, but in that ſtate they will abide, in ſpite of God, Angels, and Men, and that when God comes and proffers to Regenerate and make them New Creatures. And hence it is, that they
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:44192:49"/>ſtoutly and ſtubbornly reſiſt and riſe up in violent oppoſition againſt God, and the word of his Grace; diſputing againſt, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending with him, and the means he gives them for their change; and in effect ſay, we are well enough, why ſhould we trouble our ſelves; yea, why ſhould God concern or trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble himſelf any further with us, ſeeing we are in a ſtate of Salvation already, and may without any more ado be ſaved if God will. Men are naturally ſuch ſtrangers to their own ſtates, as that they do not, will not believe, that Regeneration is needful and abſolutely neceſſary for their Salvation, or that it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounts to any more than a bare Reformation and change of practiſe. Regeneration is ſuch a Myſtery, and they are ſo captivated to their Ignorance, Atheiſm, and Unbelief, as that they think it is but an idle ſtory, and a needleſt thing, eſpecially if they are Moral honeſt men, and great Profeſſors of the Goſpel. Hence it was, when Chriſt had to do with, and intended to convert <hi>Nicodemus,</hi> (who was a Moral and Religious honeſt man) that he preſſes the neceſſity of Regeneration on him with <hi>four Aſſeverations</hi> together; <hi>Except a man</hi> (namely, thou and others) <hi>be born again, ye cannot enter into the Kingdom of God:</hi> And <hi>mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel not at this, ye muſt be born again, Joh.</hi> 3.3.5.7. So in <hi>Matth.</hi> 18.3. <hi>Verily, I ſay to you, except ye be converted, and become as little children, ye ſhall not enter into the Kingdom of Heaven.</hi> And as they neither ſee nor believe in good earneſt, their need of Regeneration, ſo they believe
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:44192:49"/>not that God hath a mind, that he doth (in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed) propoſe, intend, or is really willing to Regenerate them; but they dream (as being under the power of their Infidelity and delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions) and perſwade themſelves, that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they read, or hear Miniſters report of theſe things, that they are but Fictions, and fancies of men, and that there is no truth nor reality in it, or if there be, yet they are not concerned in what they ſay unto them, for their effectual Conviction and Regeneration. And therefore when Chriſt ſtrives, and his Miniſters ſtrive with them, to get into their hearts, and Regenerate them, they defend themſelves, ſtand upon their ground, and do all they can to prevent and hinder them, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. <hi>ult. Heb.</hi> 3.1.15. Thus you ſee that A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſm and Unbelief is a Potent Enemy to Regeneration.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>Hatred of God and Holineſs, and their great love, ſtrong and much endeared affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to their ſins, luſts, and the world,</hi> greatly op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes Regenerating Grace, or the work of Regeneration in us. That by Nature we are haters of God, the Yoke of Chriſt, and Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of Godlineſs you have heard before; as alſo that we have great affection for, and are much in love with our Luſts, and the World. Now that theſe are exceeding great Enemies to, and obſtructions of our Regeneration, is evident in <hi>Luk.</hi> 14.16, 17, 18, 19, 20. God makes a Supper of Grace and favour for ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, makes it ready, ſets it on the Table, and ſends his Servants to invite them to come
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:44192:50"/>and eat; but would they come? no, in no wiſe: But why not? why, becauſe they had other things to mind, and, as they thought, of greater concernment; <hi>One had a Wife, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a Farm, and another Oxen.</hi> Theſe were the things they loved, minded, and ſo greatly delighted in; theſe things lay ſo near their hearts, as that they would not, could not come, nor could the moſt loving Invitation perſwade them, their worldly luſts were ſo ſtrong. This made them reject that Grace that was ſo freely and earneſtly proffered them: So Covetouſneſs cauſed the <hi>young m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>
                  </hi> to reject Chriſt, Grace, and Heaven, <hi>Luke</hi> 18.22, 23, and made him reſolve to loſe all, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than forgo that boſom luſt. He ſtood it out ſtoutly, and would not bow, or yield an inch to Chriſt, although his Life and Soul lay at ſtake for it. And to the ſame purpoſe we read in <hi>Luk.</hi> 19.27. of ſome who were ſo wedded to their luſts and intereſts, as that they peremptorily rejected Chriſts Yoke: They preferred the ſervice of Sin before the ſervice of Chriſt, and choſe rather to have their Luſts to Reign over them, than the Lord Jeſus.</p>
               <p>By Nature men are ſuch Enemies to God, and Godlineſs, I mean the power of it, as that they hate the Light that would ſhew them their errour, acquaint them with God, and bring to the ſaving knowledge of true happineſs, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.19, 20. And they are ſaid to <hi>abhor God, Zach.</hi> 11.8. and likewiſe the Word and Laws of God, <hi>Levit.</hi> 26.15. The
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:44192:50"/>Scribes and Phariſees were Religious men, and knew more than others did of the Will of God, and yet they ſtifly oppoſed the Grace and Goſpel of Chriſt, that was brought to them, for their Regeneration, if they would accept it; yea, they hated the Lord Jeſus Chriſt for proffering his Grace and Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance to them, and publiſhing the glad ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings of Salvation, <hi>Joh.</hi> 15.24, 25. And how deſperately did the Jews ſet themſelves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> Preaching Chriſt and Grace unto them? what exceeding great enmity, malignity, malice, and hatred, did they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs all along, to and againſt their Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and tendering Chriſt and his Grace unto them, for their Regeneration and Salvation, you may ſee at large in the <hi>Acts.</hi> The Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of us all by Nature is, we <hi>have loved ſtrangers, and after them we will go, Jer.</hi> 2.25. and therefore, <hi>as for the Word of the Lord, which he hath ſpoken, we will not do it, Jer.</hi> 44.16, 17. Moreover, <hi>Pride</hi> is a ſtrong and hoſtile Enemy to Regeneration: Man is a very proud Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and as full of Diabolical and Carnal Pride, as a <hi>Toad</hi> is of Poyſon. This is the Luſt that makes men ſcorn to come up to Chriſts terms, or bow to his Propoſals: They diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain to be beholding to Free Grace for any thing, and therefore will not hearken to any of Chriſts Offers. <hi>Pride</hi> ſets men in Battle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>array againſt Chriſt, to diſpute and ſight it out with him: It is ſo ſtrong a Fort, ſuch an impregnable Caſtle, as that no ſtrength can take and ſubdue it, but <hi>Omnipotency,</hi> that can
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:44192:51"/>do it, but none elſe can, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.19, 20. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 110.3. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.4, 5. This is the Luſt that makes men ſo boldly and audaciouſly <hi>ſet their mouths againſt the Heavens, Pſal.</hi> 73.9. and ſo pertinaciouſly contend with God; it cauſes men to think highly of themſelves, and vile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of Chriſt, Grace, and a New State; it makes them deſperate and reſolute in the way of their own hearts, and turn a deaf Ear to the Lords Calls and Admonitions; it cauſes them to trample on the Goſpel, Chriſt, and his Blood, and Righteouſneſs, and to harden their hearts againſt all reproofs and inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: All the Angels in Heaven, or Miniſters on Earth, cannot pull down this ſtrong hold, and it is as great an Adverſary as any Chriſt hath in the world; to obſtruct his Grace; it is the Great <hi>Goliah</hi> that ſtands in open defiance againſt Chriſt, and makes the ſtouteſt reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance againſt our Regeneration.</p>
               <p>Again, our <hi>Self-righteouſneſs</hi> is an other great obſtacle and Bull-work againſt our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation. Men have long been building up that which God will and muſt pull down, in regenerating us. God will not ſuffer our own <hi>Babels</hi> to ſtand, when he comes to ſet up <hi>Zion</hi> in our hearts; neither will he let <hi>Dagon</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, when he comes to ſet up his <hi>Ark</hi> in us. All our works, conceits, and imaginations, are but Rubbiſh and Dirt that muſt be thrown away, and caſt out, to make way for his build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and therefore God begins here, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to overturn, demoliſh, and remove out his way, the ſtrong Towers and Fortreſſes
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:44192:51"/>of our own high thoughts, conceits, works, and vain imaginations, that ſo we being left deſtitute of ſuccour, and grounds of hope in our ſelves, we may freely comply and joyn Iſſues with God in his works of Grace in us. But now, when God comes to do this, O what ſtrong reſiſtance, and violent oppoſition, doth our Self-righteouſneſs, and good conceits of our ſelves, make againſt God, and the works of his Grace: God would undo us, that he may make us; he would pull us down, and quite deface our own Structures, that he may build and ſet up his own in us. Buch ſuch are our conceits and apprehenſions of our ſufficiency, goodneſs, righteouſneſs, accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and worthy performances, as that we harden our hearts againſt all Convictions of the invalidity and nothingneſs, yea, vanity and ſinfulneſs of them; and are exceedingly averſe to, and unwilling of any alteration; cannot endure to think of loſing all that we have wrought for ſo many years, and after ſo much labour and confidence, peace and ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction in our ſtates, and what we have done, to loſe all at once, and be beholding at laſt only to the free gift of another; fleſh and blood will never endure it, and therefore makes all poſſible oppoſition againſt it. Men have been long rich and happy in their own eyes, and therefore cannot bear to be undone and impoveriſhed, to be poor and miſerable, wretched and naked. And hence it is that they ſhut their eyes, and ſtop their ears a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Light, and Gods gracious Invitations.
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:44192:52"/>They will have none of him, becauſe they fancy they have enough, and do, and may do enough of their own, to make them happy. This was the caſe of ſome of the <hi>Laodiceans, Rev.</hi> 3.17. they thought themſelves <hi>rich, and had need of nothing;</hi> and that when they were <hi>wretched, naked, and miſerable.</hi> Thus it was with <hi>Paul</hi> before he was Regenerated, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.4, 5, 6, 7. And this was one of the great ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions that hindred the Jews from recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Grace of Chriſt, tendred them by Chriſt and his Apoſtles, <hi>John</hi> 8, and 9, <hi>Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</hi> And in <hi>Luke</hi> 18.9, 10, 11, 12. their ſelf-conceited righteouſneſs and light, their pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges and good works, made them ſuch deſperate, reſolute, violent, and ſtout oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers of the Grace of God; and thus is ſtill the nature and effect of it in all the Sons and Daughters of men, as ſad experience ſhews.</p>
               <p>And as Self-righteouſneſs, and a good O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion of our ſelves, is a ſtrong Bar to fence us againſt Gods Regenerating work, ſo are vain and groundleſs hopes likewiſe. Theſe oppoſitions and contradictions do all hang together in a ſtring, as ſo many Links in a Chain; where one is, all are; but one may be ſtronger in one man, and another in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther man. Men are by Nature exceeding full of preſumptious hopes and confidences, they ſeign that God will ſave them, becauſe he is good and merciful to ſinners, although they continue in their filthineſs and practical abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations, in their blindneſs and unregene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate ſtates. The Conceptions of Gods Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:44192:52"/>proves ſnares and dangerous Rocks to unregenerate men, while they confidently conclude that God will have mercy on, and ſave them, becauſe he is merciful, though they live and die in their unregenerate ſtates and condition, although the Word of God tell them the contrary, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 27.11. This is the <hi>vain hope of hypocrites,</hi> mentioned in <hi>Job</hi> 8.13, 14. which <hi>ſhall periſh with them.</hi> Preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious confidences, and vain hopes, are natural to us, and we will take hold of any broken Reed to keep us from deſpondency, or ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king a right judgment of our ſelves, ſtates, and ways, rather than yield to the counſels of God, and ſuffer him to ſave us in his own way, and by his own means. This vain pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptious hope, is that which arms and ſtrengthens the Soul againſt Chriſt, and lies in a direct oppoſition to our Regeneration.</p>
               <p>Again, <hi>Hardneſs of heart</hi> is a great Bar to Regeneration. We are by Nature hardened in ſin, and in fond conceits of our good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions; and therefore the work of Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration in us, muſt needs be very hard and diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult work. We are ſo hardened by ſin, and we harden our ſelves more and more, when God hands out Light to us to ſee our ſtates, and lead us to himſelf. When God comes to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate, then we are moſt inſenſible of our conditions, and harden our hearts moſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, even then when he would ſoften and melt us, break and humble us; we were hard and knotty pieces before, but then we make our ſelves much harder; for then
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:44192:53"/>we do purpoſely and deſignedly ſet our ſelves againſt God and his workings; and as water ſtrives with greater vehemency againſt oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, ſo do our hard hearts againſt the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits operations in us, to renew and change us, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 3.7. <hi>Pharoah</hi> was a hard-hearted man before God ſent <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> to him, but then he ſet himſelf to harden his heart a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God, and his Word, more than ever. So when God ſent the means of Grace to the Jews, and ſtrove with them to bring them to himſelf, the more he wreſtled with them, exhorted, and perſwaded them to receive his Grace, and become New Creatures, the more they ſtrove and fought againſt him, <hi>Acts</hi> 19. <hi>Acts</hi> 28. until God judicially hardened them alſo, and then they were ſealed up (as it were) to the day of wrath, <hi>Joh.</hi> 12.40. Then 'tis ever after a <hi>hard and impenitent heart, Rom.</hi> 2.5.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, <hi>Enmity.</hi> There is in every natural man moſt ſtout and ſtrong Enmity againſt God, which is <hi>implacable and irreconcileable.</hi> There can no peace or friendſhip be had with an implacable Enemy, and a man that is at real Enmity with us, until he be changed. The <hi>Carnal mind</hi> is not only an Enemy to God, but <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>Emnity</hi> againſt God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.7. And in <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.31. they are ſaid to be <hi>implacable.</hi> Enmity will never be won and made to yield, either by fair or foul means; but ſuch is the nature of it, as that it will rather die on the place, than conform to any tolerable terms of friendſhip with an
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:44192:53"/>Adverſary. But the Enmity of our Natures is moſt ſtout, ſtubborn, and deſperate againſt God; for 'tis poſſible for a man to perſwade him that is at Enmity with him, to ſome rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable terms of accommodation, by his great condeſcention and bowing to him, by ſweet and affable carriages, by the entreaty and perſwaſion of Friends, and by proffering to ſerve him, and give him all he hath.</p>
               <p>But it is not ſo between men and God; for although God condeſcends, and as it were bows down to us, and that infinitely more than men can do, though he carry himſelf moſt ſweetly and affably to us, proffers friendſhip and reconciliation to us, entreats and perſwades us by his Miniſters, promiſes and proffers to wait on us, protect, and guard us; yea, give all he hath to inrich us, honour and exalt us with all his Sons Fulneſs, and poſſeſs us of all his Heavenly Treaſures, if we will yield and be reconciled to him. But all theſe endeavours are in vain, none of them will work on Enmity, to perſwade and bow it to the Will and Deſigns of God; yea, theſe means are all contemned, and are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved to heighten and ſtrengthen the Enmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty by us. Enmity cauſes men to bid defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to ſuch Acts and Overtures of God for the winning and bringing us over to himſelf; they make us more obſtinate, implacable, and irreconcileable. The Jews give us a ſufficient proof of this Truth, as well as what is daily found amongſt us: For who ſhews greater Enmity againſt Chriſt, his Grace, and Goſpel,
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:44192:54"/>than ſuch to whom he daily holds forth the Golden Scepter of his Mercy, and beſeeches to be reconciled to him.</p>
               <p>Theſe are ſome of the ſtout Enemies of our Regeneration, which are bred in our own Boſoms, and ſtrongly arm and fortifie our Souls againſt Chriſt. Theſe are ſome of the <hi>Goliah</hi>'s that rebel againſt the Authority and Commands of God, and that hold faſt the Caſtles of our hearts, and keep them ſhut againſt him, when he comes to aſſault and ſubdue them; and ſo makes our Rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration very hard and difficult. I could have inſtanced in ſeveral other internal oppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, but time would fail me.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>Without, and within us too.</hi> The Devil is an external and internal Adverſary to the work of Regeneration; he is an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placable and active Enemy to and againſt our New State; for he hates Chriſt, and his Grace in men, and cannot endure to ſee a holy <hi>Job,</hi> or gracious <hi>Paul</hi> in the world; and therefore endeavours to make and keep all men like himſelf, and leaves no means unattempted to effect it, but <hi>goes about night and day, ſeeking whom he may devour,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.8. There is an Everlaſting <hi>Enmity put between the Seed of the Woman, and the Seed of the Serpent, Gen.</hi> 3. and much more between the Devil and Grace. And as the Devil hates Chriſt, and his Grace in men, ſo likewiſe the happy and bleſſed ſtate that the Grace of Regeneration puts them into. He knows that he is a moſt mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable Creature himſelf, being condemned,
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:44192:54"/>and put into <hi>Chains of darkneſs, to everlaſting fire, Jude</hi> 6. <hi>Matth.</hi> 25.41. And therefore he greatly envies and malignes the happineſs of good men. It cuts him to the heart to ſee any of the Sons of <hi>Adam</hi> reſtored to a ſtate of Bleſſedneſs; to ſee the Grace of God in them, and they in Friendſhip with God. For no ſooner had God made <hi>man in his own I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, Gen.</hi> 1.26, 27. ſet them in Paradiſe, and given them a poſitive Law to obey; but by and by, he ſets on them to debauch and ſpoil them, and uſes all poſſible ſubtilty and diligence to effect it, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. which ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed according to his mind for a time. So when he ſaw <hi>Job</hi> walk uprightly, and in high fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour with God, how does he labour to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt him, and turn him from his integrity, in the firſt and ſecond <hi>Chapter</hi> of <hi>Job.</hi> And as the Devil envies the happineſs of good men, and therefore labours to hinder their Rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, ſo likewiſe his loathneſs to looſe his Subjects. The Devil is the <hi>God and Lord of the World,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.4. <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.2. and hath many willing and obedient <hi>Subjects, Rom.</hi> 6. We are all by Nature the Devils Subjects and Servants, he hath the firſt poſſeſſion of, and ſervice from us; and when God Regenerates a man, he takes him out of the Devils King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and calls him out of his ſubjection and ſervice, and puts him into his Kingdom and ſervice, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.13. <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. Now this is ſo grievous to him, as that he cannot quietly bear it, but doth all he can to hinder and obſtruct it, and that by all poſſible ways and
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:44192:55"/>means. He is in poſſeſſion, and rules in the hearts, <hi>Luk.</hi> 11.20, 21, 22. and will not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

He flatters and perſwades them to mind their pleaſures and profits, and not trouble or concern themſelves about Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, for that will but diſtract and perplex them, and no way advantage them. He tells them, that in their preſent ſtate they may have their hearts deſire, but ſo they ſhall not have in the ſingular and melancholly ways of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, which now they begin to concern themſelves withal; and that if they once in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage themſelves in thoſe matters, they ſhall never find any good, or ſatisfaction in them, comparable to that which they muſt forgo, and part withal, and which hitherto they have, and hereafter they may more fully en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy in their preſent ſtates and practiſes.

It is the <hi>Devil</hi> likewiſe that obſtructs and hinders the Preaching of the Goſpel to men, by ſuch Inſtruments as he is pleaſed to make uſe of for that end and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. Thus he made uſe of the Jews to keep the Goſpel from the Gentiles, when the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles were ſent to them with it; and if he cannot keep the Goſpel from men, he wil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Thus the Devil wrought and prevailed on <hi>Stephen</hi> his hearers. In <hi>Acts</hi> 7. it is ſaid, when he preached to them, <hi>they ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped their ears.</hi>
               </p>

               <p>But beſides theſe, there is another great obſtruction in the way of Regeneration, and that is the <hi>World.</hi> The good and bad people, and things of this world, are great hinderan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of our Regeneration: The unworthy walkings of many Profeſſors of the good ways of Chriſt, and the reproaches and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutions of the wicked, are no ſmall lets and impediments to, and of Regeneration. So are alſo the <hi>riches, pleaſures, and honours</hi> of this World. Theſe pull back the hearts of men, and keep them <hi>from entering into the Kingdom of Heaven, Luk.</hi> 18.22, 23. and theſe take off mens thoughts from ſerious minding of their ſtates, and another world. Theſe things lye ſo deep in our minds and affections, and do ſo powerfully delude and bewitch all our ſenſes, that we have no minds, wills, or incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, to mind or ſet our hearts on things above; yea, they have ſo great an intereſt in us, and authority over us, as that they do command our moſt ſerious and fixed atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance on them, and greedy purſuit after them, whereby the Calls and Commands of God are ſhut out of our hearts. The ſmiles and good things of this world, are the Gods, or rather Idols of our hearts, the <hi>Lovers</hi> that we dote on, and are fond of, and the great deſire and delight of our Souls; and they being ſo, it is as eaſie for us to pull the Sun
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:44192:57"/>out of Heaven, as our hearts from theſe things. We may as well change a <hi>Black-mor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </hi> Skin white, or empty the Sea with a <hi>Nut-ſhell,</hi> as to empty and caſt out the World of our hearts, and change their courſe and way. Earthly things are our Lords, and hold us faſt, as Priſoners in their Chains. We are their Humble Servants, and at their beck we go and come: We are ſwallowed up in them at a Ship in a <hi>Gulf,</hi> and they are enthroned and fixed in our hearts, as in their proper place and center. We mind and affect Earthly good things (by Nature) as our Heaven, Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and ſatisfying good; and ſee not, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will we be perſwaded without Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating Grace, that there is indeed any higher or greater happineſs, or real ſatisfaction to be found, than what they can afford us. Theſe are called their <hi>good things,</hi> becauſe they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count them ſo, and are well pleaſed and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented with them, without Chriſt and his Grace. They had rather live in ſin, blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and under the wrath of God, with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of them, then in Heaven, and under Regeneration, without them, <hi>Luk.</hi> 12.16, 17, 18, 20. <hi>Luk.</hi> 16.25. <hi>Luk.</hi> 18.22, 23, 24.</p>
               <p>Oh! How common is it with men to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs Sea and Land for the World; to labour and toil night and day to get, ſpend, and be ſpent to keep it, when gotten, yea, to <hi>hazard and venture</hi> their lives, and Souls too, to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and ſecure it; and that becauſe of their exceſſive and inordinate love to, and delight in theſe things. Men will much more wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:44192:57"/>part with Chriſt, Grace, and Heaven, than with their Riches, Honours, and Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures. Hence Chriſt tells his Diſciples, <hi>that it is a hard matter for them to be ſaved that are rich, Luk.</hi> 18.24.25.</p>
               <p>Now when Chriſt comes to regenerate and change our ſtates, he <hi>calls us off from ſo mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, affecting,</hi> and taking up with theſe things, and <hi>to mind, follow, and ſet our hearts on heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Col.</hi> 3.1, 2. And this is ſo croſs and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary unto the Natural Genius of our hearts and courſe of our lives, our ſatisfaction and ſuppoſed happineſs, as that we will by no means be convinced of our folly, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded to come to Chriſt, accept of him, and his Regenerating Grace for our portion and happineſs, until he puts forth his <hi>Almighty Power</hi> to work and perſwade us to it. And O what a hard and difficult work hath Chriſt to do in us, and for us? What a world of ſtout oppoſitions, and implacable Oppoſers, doth Chriſt meet withal in this work? The Luſts of our Hearts, the Devil and World, Carnal and Spiritual Self, do all combine together, to make Head and ſtrong oppoſition againſt the Lord Jeſus, when he would Regenerate us.</p>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Yea, they may, and it is certain that many are ſo convinced, but very loath they are to know it, and exceeding unwilling to think themſelves to be ſo, and greatly provoked with ſuch friends as tell them that they are in an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil caſe, and unconverted ſtate; for we are all by nature exceeding proud and ſelf-conceited. We think too well of our own conditions, ſtates, and ways, and imagin that all others ſhould have the ſame opinion of them that we our ſelves have. And therefore conclude, that ſuch as think and ſpeak otherwiſe of them, are too uncharitable and cenſorious. This is one of the greateſt ſtumbling blocks in the way of Regeneration, and cauſes many to tune a deaf ear to all convincing and regenerating Truths that are handed out unto them. Beſides the vain groundleſs hopes they have formed to themſelves, and are greatly in love withal, that they are in a good and ſafe condition, (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they are not ſo good as they ſhould be) whatever men and the word of God ſhall ſay
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:44192:58"/>to the contrary, of or againſt them. The <hi>Jews</hi> gives us many proofs and evidences of it, for when the Lord Jeſus Preached to, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſed with them about their ſtates, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince and regenerate them. Oh! how did they labour to fence off all the words of Truth ſpoken to them, how did they ſtrive, diſpute, and ſet themſelves againſt the Goſpel of their Salvation, and that upon the grounds before mentioned; yea, thoſe very perſons which ſometimes were <hi>convinced in their Conſciences that they were ſinners, Joh.</hi> 8.9. I ſay, even theſe men did ordinarily harden themſelves againſt the Word of Chriſt, upon their vain hopes, high priviledges, proud and high conceits they had of themſelves, <hi>Joh.</hi> 8.33.39, 48.—<hi>ult Joh.</hi> 9. <hi>Joh.</hi> 10. <hi>Math.</hi> 9. Read theſe Chapters through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, and you will find what I have ſaid abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly confirmed, and as it was with them, ſo I am afraid it is with many of you; do not you conceit, and ſtoutly perſwade your ſelves, that you are in a ſafe and happy ſtate and condition before God, that you ſhall undoubtedly be ſaved, notwithſtanding the Truth of God, Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of Chriſt, yea, and ſometimes your own Conſciences teſtify the contrary alſo, and tell you plainly, <hi>That you are yet in the gall of bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and bond of Iniquity?</hi> do not you encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage and ſupport your ſelves, fortify and arm your ſelves under and againſt all convictions, with many vain and groundleſs hopes and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſive conceits of your bleſſed ſtates, or that you are in a happy caſe and condition, although you never experienced any real change in your
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:44192:59"/>hearts, nor any ſpecial grace of Chriſt in your poor deluded periſhing Souls?</p>
               <p>But yet I ſay, unregenerate perſons may know, and have a <hi>ſhrewd gueſs,</hi> that they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves are not unregenerated, but in a ſtate of ſin, and under the wrath of God. <hi>Simon Magat</hi> was ſo, <hi>Acts</hi> 8.24. <hi>Pharoah, Exod.</hi> 9.27. unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate men have three means, (if I may ſo call them) to help them to the knowledge and conviction of their bad conditions. Firſt, the word of God written, but eſpecially Preached; and ſo it is the word of conviction in the hand of an Ordinance, appointed and deſigned there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto by the great God, <hi>Act.</hi> 26.18. (2) Their own natural Conſciences, and principles of Nature that are in all men, not feared, which are ſubjects capable of impreſſions from the Word of God, namely of its light and convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing power: and alſo natural Reaſon helped by the Word; ſo that when they hear the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Characters</hi> of unregenerate perſons laid down from Gods Word; they may reflect on themſelves, and apply them to themſelves if they will. They may reaſon thus, why, if theſe are certain Characters or Signs of an evil or unregenerate man or ſtate, as I cannot but conclude they are: then am I in ſuch a ſtate, for I find them in and upon me, I cannot deny it. As thus, Is groſs ignorance of Jeſus Chriſt, the grace of God, Sin and Duty, a certain ſign of an unregenerate perſon, ſurely then I am an unregenerate perſon, for I am groſly ignorant of theſe things. So when they hear Characters
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:44192:59"/>or Signs laid down of a regenerate man, then to examin themſelves, and reaſon thus, Why, I find not any of theſe in my ſelf, which I ſhould if I was regenerate, and therefore I am in an unregenerate ſtate and condition: much might be done this way, by unregenerate men to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards their conviction and knowledge (I mean not ſaving knowledge) of their States; would ſuch men practiſe it, but that they will not, no, becauſe they love their carnal eaſe and peace, and therefore they are willingly ignorant of their unregenerate ſtate. And as they have theſe means or helps to know their evil States, ſo (3) the holy Spirit of God, to ſtir up Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience in and by the Word. The Spirit ſpeaks ſometimes to them, (not as the Spirit of Adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but of Bondage) whoſe voice is louder, quicker, and pierceth further unto, and into their Conſciences, than the word of its ſelf can do, and tells them plainly, that they are in a damnable ſtate and condition, and ſhall aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redly periſh for ever, except they be regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate here, <hi>Gen.</hi> 6.3. This awakens and affrights them, this humbles and abaſes them, and makes them cry out, undone, undone, we are loſt; <hi>Oh! what ſhall we do to be ſaved? Acts</hi> 2.37. And here I might add, that not only theſe ſaid means may help them to the knowledge of their ſtates, but alſo the diſcourſes, carriages, and converſations of ſome Regenerate perſons that they are concerned withal, and may make obſervations of, and compare themſelves with them, and them with themſelves, and conclude (clearly) that there is a vaſt difference between
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:44192:60"/>ſuch and themſelves, the ſtates of the one, and of the other. And if theſe be Regenerate perſons, and Regenerate perſons be indeed ſuch, and ſo and ſo qualified, graced and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rited, as they ſeem to be, then that they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves are undoubtedly in an Unregenerate condition; for that they are not ſuch perſons, neither have any of their qualifications, or any like them, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.16. Now, if Unregenerate men would improve, and rationally uſe theſe means or helps towards the knowledge and conviction of their ſtates, they might un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly know them better than they do. But there needs no further proof of this truth, namely, that unregenerate perſons may know they are in a bad condition, then the <hi>Gripes, and trouble of Conſcience,</hi> their fears, trembling, and conſternations, in and under the appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions of Death and Judgment, together with their wiſhes, proteſtations, reſolutions, and promiſes, on their Death-beds; Theſe do all proclaim this Truth.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>May not Gods people, ſuch as are Regenerate, know that they are ſo, and be ſufficiently aſſured of their Regeneration?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> They may, for firſt, God hath <hi>promiſed</hi> the knowledge of it unto them, in their obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient and holy walkings with God in that ſtate, <hi>Hoſea</hi> 6.3. <hi>Then ſhall we know, if we follow on to know the Lord.</hi> Iſa. 32.17. <hi>Prov.</hi> 2.1.<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="2">2. The people of God have had certain and clear aſſurance, or a ſufficient knowledge of
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:44192:60"/>their Regenerate ſtates, and the Spirit of God hath recorded it, for our learning and encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement <hi>Enoch</hi> had it, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.5. and the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle <hi>John</hi> ſpeaking in the name of Believers, or regenerate perſons, ſaith, <hi>We know that we are of God,</hi> That we are <hi>tranſlated from Death to Life, and hereby know we that we are in him,</hi> 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.5.3.14.5.19. And <hi>Paul</hi> tells us, that they, namely, he and other Regenerate Perſons, <hi>had received the Spirit, that they might know the things which were freely given to them of God,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.12. Now, if it was certainly known by the Saints of old, ſuch as run their Race before us; then we may obtain it now; for we live under the ſame God, Chriſt, Grace, Promiſes, Love, Spirit, and means of aſſurance that they did, and we have as much need of it as they had upon all accounts. And as we have theſe, and many other Scripture Evidences or Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples, (I mean the Saints mentioned in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture) ſo we have had many undoubted Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonies of it in and from many good men in our days, and the latter Ages before us. How that ſome on their Death-Beds, others in the days of their proſperity, others in their tryals and temptations: Some in one Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of God, and ſome in another; ſome in Priſon, and ſome at the Stake; ſome under the loſs of their Goods and Reproaches for Chriſts ſake, have gotten clear, and heart ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſhing Aſſurance of their Regeneration and bleſſed States. I ſay, we have this Truth confirmed to us by their worthy Teſtimonies, and glorious Experiences. And aſſuredly,
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:44192:61"/>what they had, we alſo may obtain in the ſame way, in and by the uſe of the ſame means, and in the ſame, or like caſe and condition.</p>
               <p n="2">2. God hath commanded Regenerate Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and ſo hath made it their Duty, to get and keep aſſurance of their new States; and God would never have preſcribed ſuch a means, and commanded our diligent uſe of it as our duty, in order to the obtainment of the end, but that the ſaid end is attainable by, and ſhall moſt certainly be obtained in the faithful conſtant uſe of it. For as his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands makes the work or means our duty, ſo the <hi>End</hi> propounded, namely, of the duty to be done by us, is the obtainment of aſſurance, ſo I ſay, it is an object of our Faith and Hope: And upon Gods propounding it to us as the end of the duty commended, we are to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve and hope in the performance of the duty to obtain the end, (that is) aſſurance of our being tranſlated from Death to Life; namely, that God will bleſs his own means, to effect and accompliſh his own ends to and in us, and he will by no means diſappoint us, or make us aſhamed of our truſting him, hoping in, and waiting for him to grant us the end he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to us, commanded us to ſeek it, that we might find it, and which we have endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured with all our hearts to obtain in his own way, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 49.20. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 54.4. Now God hath charged us to examin and prove our ſelves, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.5. And to <hi>give diligence to make our Calling and Election ſure,</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.10. And to worſhip him, <hi>in full aſſurance of Faith,</hi>
                  <pb n="111" facs="tcp:44192:61"/>Heb. 10.22. that is, in the certain perſwaſion of Gods Truth, All-ſufficiency, and Faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in his Promiſes, and of <hi>Chriſt his being a High-Prieſt over the Houſe of God, verſ.</hi> 21. So likewiſe of our Intereſt and Right to and in all.</p>
               <p n="4">4. God hath given us many <hi>Rules and Marks</hi> in his Word, to help us in our Tryals of our ſtates, and to make a comfortable and ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory judgment of them, whether we are indeed Regenerate or no. Very much of the New Teſtament was written for that end, <hi>that we might know we have Eternal Life,</hi> ſaith <hi>John,</hi> 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.13. All which Scripture had been to little or no purpoſe, if aſſurance, after all, were not attainable. But it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent that it is attainable, and that all Rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate perſons may attain unto and obtain it, becauſe God hath given them ſuch proper and ſuitable means and helps for the obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of it. There are many of them ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered up and down the Scriptures, I'le name one or two; that in 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.14. <hi>We know that we are paſſed from death to life, becauſe we love the Brethren;</hi> that is, here is a certain and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible ſign or mark of a New Creature, his loving of good men; that is, if you can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ſay, and ſoundly experience, that you do love a holy man, or gracious men as ſuch, rightly, truly, heartily, with a ſpiritual and ſpecial love, becauſe they are ſuch, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to Chriſt; why then you may conclude, that you are in a ſtate of Grace, and paſſed from death to life. So that if I can make
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:44192:62"/>good the leſſer Propoſition, the Goſpel will prove and make good the firſt or greater Propoſition thus; He that loves the Brethren (that is rightly, and in a true Goſpel ſenſe) is paſſed from death to life, but I do ſo love the Brethren; therefore I am paſſed from death to life. Now that which we have to do in the caſe is this; namely, to get the clear proof of the ſecond part, thus, I do know that I do ſo love the Brethren, according to the true purport and meaning of that, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Texts</hi> of Scripture; and then conclude from this Scripture, and others of the like import, that I am paſſed from death to life; that is, I am Regenerated. (2.) An other ſign or mark of Regenerate men laid down in Scripture is this; that <hi>they deſire the ſincere Milk of the Word, that they may grow thereby,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.2. Now if I am a <hi>Babe</hi> in Chriſt, I do deſire the ſincere Milk of the Word of God, that I may (not only eat it) but eat it to grow thereby; to grow up in Chriſt, Grace, and in the practiſe and fruits of holineſs; and if I do ſo deſire the ſincere Milk of the Word, then I am (at leaſt) a Babe, or young Child of God. But this is not my work, or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent deſign; and therefore do but little more than mention theſe things; namely, to ſhew that Unregenerate and Regenerate perſons may know the ſtates and conditions wherein they are; the one in and by ſin, the other in and by Grace. But I thought good to ſay a little of it, and but a little, as a prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to that which I have further to ſay, and
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:44192:62"/>which was mainly intended as the ſubject matter of this <hi>Chapter.</hi>

               <p>Q. <hi>What are ſome of the most certain Signs, Characters, or Marks of Regenerate and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nregene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate perſons or ſtates?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Much hath been ſaid already in open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the work of Regeneration, what it was, and what was contained in it, as you may ſee in that <hi>Chapter;</hi> and therefore I ſhall ſay the leſs here: But yet I ſhall endeavour to preſent ſo much unto you, in this Chapter or Head, as ſhall fully anſwer and reſolve the Queſtion.</p>
               <p>Firſt, A Regenerate perſon hath <hi>new life.</hi> It is a <hi>New Creature, Gal.</hi> 6.15. and it is a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving lively Creature; it is not born dead, but alive; it is alive to God, <hi>to live unto him in newneſs of life, Rom.</hi> 6.4.10.11. <hi>To bring forth fruit unto God, Rom.</hi> 7.4. And men <hi>are created in Christ Jeſus unto good works, Eph.</hi> 2.10. It is a heavenly and ſpiritual Creature, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.3.5. exactly fitted to heavenly, and ſuited to ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual objects, matters, works, and enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which the Natural Man is not, now in it's lapſed and depraved ſtate. Chriſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires a new life of them; and in order thereunto, creates and forms it in them, <hi>Joh.</hi> 10.10. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.14. This New Creature hath, and it is formed with all it's ſenſes. It hath <hi>five Spiritual Senſes,</hi> in alluſion to the five Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Senſes of men; though all of them cannot be ſo properly and plainly expreſt, as the Natural Senſes may; it is a perfect New Creature, and therefore muſt have all it's
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:44192:63"/>parts and ſenſes. I ſhall open them to you as briefly as I may.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Senſe of <hi>Seeing.</hi> When God made the World, his firſt days work was <hi>Light, Gen.</hi> 1.3. <hi>Let there be light, and there was light,</hi> (ſays the Text.) So in this new Creation, the firſt Senſe in order that is Created, and doth firſt appear, is the Senſe of Seeing. Before Rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration (as you have heard) we are <hi>blind, and in darkneſs, Matth.</hi> 15.14. <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.8. We know not (to purpoſe) what we are, not where we are, whoſe we are, nor where to find true happineſs. By ſin we put out our own Eyes, quenched our Candle, and drew a thick Cloud before our Eyes, and utterly ſpoiled them; our ſpiritual knowledge of heavenly things, and Soul-concernments, is deſtroyed, and there is none of that Light remaining, to conduct us in acceptable obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience in the way to Heaven. Therefore as it is abſolutely neceſſary that we ſhould have new Eyes, as well as new Light to ſee withal: So God doth in Regeneration give men new Eyes, and Light, called the <hi>Eyes of their <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding, Eph.</hi> 1.18. Upon this Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rand was <hi>Paul</hi> ſent with the Goſpel to the Gentiles, <hi>Acts</hi> 26.18. and having received this new Spiritual Light, they are ever after <hi>cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Children of Light,</hi> as they were called before <hi>Children of Darkneſs, Eph.</hi> 5.8. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.9, 10, 11. In Regeneration they <hi>are called out of this Darkneſs into marvellous Light,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.9. This their new ſight, light, and power of diſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, is excellent, ſpiritual, ſpecial, and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cullar,
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:44192:63"/>and that in many reſpects. Theſe are ſome of them. 1. They can now ſee the things, and diſcern the matters and objects they could not ſee before. 2. Other things, objects and matters, more plainly and clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, more lovely, precious, excellent, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable. Firſt, they ſee the things that they never ſaw before: As 1. The evil of their Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. The Light of Nature may ſhew men many of their actual ſins and wickedneſſes, but not the Source and Fountain of them; namely, our Original, Natural, and Habitual vileneſs and ſinfulneſs; only Regenerate per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons ſee a far greater odiouſneſs and abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation in the heart, than in the life; they find by ſad experience, that the Fountain of corrupt Nature is more full of Poyſon, than any Acts of ſin; and the ſight of that cauſes ſuch out-crys in them, <hi>O wretched men that we are, who ſhall deliver us from the Body of this Death? Rom.</hi> 7.24. And <hi>purge me,</hi> (that is, the filthy Spring of the heart) <hi>that I may be clean; waſh me, and I ſhall be whiter than Snow, Pſal.</hi> 51. <hi>For out of the heart proceeds all abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, Matth.</hi> 15.18, 19. and the Fountain and Root muſt needs be more full of evil, than the ſtreams and branches are. This the ſpiritual eye of the New Creature ſees; he hath it not by hear-ſay, but ſees it in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and ſo does not the Carnal and Natural eye of man.</p>
               <p n="2">2. They ſee and know by their new ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual light, ſpiritual ſins; yea, they ſee and know a greater ſinfulneſs in them, in ſome
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:44192:64"/>ſenſe, than in fleſhly ſins, and ſo do not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regenerate men. They do indeed ſee an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil in ſome external ſins, ſuch as are ſeen and condemned by the Light of Nature, and that by all men; as Drunkenneſs, Theft, Whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, Curſing, Railing, Back-biting, Slau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering, Swearing, Cheating, Blaſphemy, Pride in Words, Carriages, Cloaths, Cruelty, Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, and the like; but they ſee not, nor apprehend the horrible evils of Atheiſm, Spiritual Pride, Self, Vain-glory, Envy, Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſie towards God, Unbelief, Covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, corrupting the Worſhip of God, and his Goſpel-Ordinances, Earthly-mindedneſs, robbing God of his due, departing from God, malice againſt, and hatred of the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of Godlineſs, and the People of God, and ſuch like heart and ſpiritual wickedneſſes. Theſe are little things in an unregenerate mans eye, becauſe he wants a ſpiritual under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding and light to diſcern what they are; but they are hainous abominations to a ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual eye, for it knows and ſees what they are (in meaſure) and paſſes a ſpiritual judgment on them, as ſins more fully and immediatel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

But it is not ſo with unregenerate men; they ſee not any Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion or Godlineſs beyond the form or out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide; it is not formed or ſet up in their hearts; and therefore ſee little or nothing in Religion, Godlineſs, or Religious mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. But unregenerate men do ſee and find a glorious Excellency in it; it is exceeding precious, lovely, and profitable to them: They ſee that worth and Excellency in it, as to cauſe them to love and honour it, to prize, value, and eſteem it, as worthy of all accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation; to cheriſh, keep, and augment it, to improve and practiſe it, and to walk worthy of it, to the glory of the Giver of it.</p>
               <p n="7">7. They ſee and know the <hi>vanity and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thingneſs of the Creature,</hi> and that they are not indeed ſuch things as they verily thought them to be before their Regeneration. Their Opinion of them is changed, it is now quite another thing. Before they looked on them, and their having and enjoying them, as their portion and happineſs: Oh, thought they, what a brave thing is it to be rich? what happy men are they who have abundance of riches, honours, pleaſures? they doted on them as on their Gods and Lovers, and their very imaginations of them raviſhed their hearts; but now they ſee their folly, and
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:44192:66"/>how they were miſtaken and deluded in their judgments and imaginations. They now ſee them to be <hi>but vanity and vexation of ſpirit,</hi> in compariſon of Chriſt, Grace, and Heavenly things, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 1.2. <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.19, 20. 'Tis true, they do not now ſimply contemn them, but own them, and uſe them as Gods Mercies, thank and praiſe him for them; but compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratively only, with Chriſt, Grace, and Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly things. Now they ſee that they are but left-hand and foot-ſtool Mercies; that they are not worth the having, nor coveting after, but with and in Chriſt, Grace, Pardon, and Holineſs, and in order to their living to God with them, and enjoying of him in them. But unregenerate men ſee them with other eyes, and they have other thoughts of them. <hi>They account them their good things,</hi> as the only or chiefeſt good, their great por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and happineſs, and accordingly they act, walk, and ſteer their courſe; follow after them, and greedily purſue them, <hi>Luk.</hi> 16.25. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.5. For indeed whatever they do pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, or pretend to the contrary, they do not ſee, nor mind any higher good.</p>
               <p n="8">8. They ſee and know the <hi>vanity and emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tineſs</hi> of that which they did bear upon, and glory in, namely, <hi>their own Righteouſneſs.</hi> They once thought that they had that in them, and ſuch works were performed by them, as would commend them unto God, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline his heart to love and pity them, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept and ſave them. But now they ſee they were deceived, <hi>that all their Righteouſneſſes are
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:44192:66"/>but filthy rags,</hi> dirt, and dung; and that they are ſo far from being accepted, or accounted of in Heaven, as that they are matters of contempt and loathing, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.7, 8. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 64.6. <hi>Matth.</hi> 23. So that that which was their glory, is now their ſhame. Their Gay Cloa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing are now meer Rags in their account; Why? Becauſe they ſee with other eyes, and by a better light than they did before. They ſee they were building themſelves on a San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Bottom, which would have ſunk under them, and they and it muſt have periſhed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, had they not been taken off it by the power of Regenerating Grace. But now this is all they have to glory in, who are Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors of Godlineſs, in an unregenerate ſtate, namely, <hi>God, I thank thee, I am not as other men; I faſt twice in the week; I give Tythes of all that I poſſeſs,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Luke</hi> 18.9, 10, 11, 12. <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.7.</p>
               <p n="9">9. They ſee and know the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and his Goſpel-will, revealed in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; they are ſpiritualized, and made ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual men by Regeneration, and thereby are enabled to <hi>judge all, or of all ſpiritual things</hi> (in meaſure) 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.15. They heard of Chriſt and his Will before, but now they ſee and know him, and it. But more of this anone.</p>
               <p n="10">10. They ſee and know in meaſure, the great work of real <hi>Goſpel-Obedience,</hi> what it is, &amp; how to be performed; and alſo, the holy Ghoſt his teachings, helpings, quickenings, and comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, in and to their <hi>Goſpel-Obedience.</hi> They ſee wide difference between meer doing of that which is good, and that with and by meer natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:44192:67"/>helps and principles, and that which is real <hi>Goſpel Obedience of the heart in it, Ro.</hi> 6.17. as like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the <hi>Spirits helping their Infirmities, Ro.</hi> 8.26. But Unregenerate men know nothing of theſe matters. But I have done with this. Theſe are ſome, and but ſome of the things, mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and objects, which by regenerating light, they are enabled to ſee and diſcern; as you that are regenerated can witneſs. Now then, try your ſelves by what hath been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready ſaid, of ſeeing, or of the ſeeing and knowing ſenſe.</p>
               <p>Secondly, as Regenerate Perſons can ſee, and do know the matters and things they ſaw not before; ſo ſecondly, they are enabled to ſee and underſtand ſuch ſpiritual things and matters which they had ſome knowledge of before their Regeneration, more clearly, plainly, diſtinctly, experimentally, and power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, then they did or could before. For they had only a dim, weak, and general natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, and ſpiritual light, and ſight before. They did ſee, but underſtood not what they ſaw, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 6.9. They are like Men or Children that ſee ſome rare and pretious Jewels, or Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dials, but know not what they are, neither underſtand the worth, excellency, and uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of them, as <hi>Artificers</hi> do, or like ſuch as hear Muſick in a ſtrange Tone and Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, they know not what it means; ſo at the beſt their ſight and knowledge is an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain, weak, and unedifying knowledge. Their ſight and knowledge of theſe matters, profit them not. It lies idle and uſeleſs in the
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:44192:67"/>head, but is of no advantage to the heart. It brings them not to the things they ſee, to cloſe up with them, and make them their choice, to apply and rightly to appropriate them unto themſelves. No, but they ſtill lay at a diſtance from their hearts, and their hearts from them. They ſee no tranſcendent worth and excellency in them, to cauſe them indeed to deſire them, and with ſelf-denial to make them their own. But they are enabled by Regeneration <hi>to ſee and underſtand Spiritual things ſpiritually,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.13.14. They have <hi>now Eyes to ſee withal, Epheſ.</hi> 1.18. and a new light to ſee by, namely, <hi>The Sun of Righteouſneſs, Mal.</hi> 4.2. The <hi>Glory of the Lord is riſen upon them, Iſa</hi> 60.1. But before they ſaw with their old eyes, though it may be they were a little anoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with ſome common ſpiritual Light ſtill, yet they were but their old natural Eyes, or ſenſe of ſeeing, and they had only Candle light to ſee ſpiritual things by; But Rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate perſons are <hi>called out of darkneſs, into marvellous light,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.9. <hi>The light of the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Glory of God ſhines into their hearts,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.6. enabling them with a meaſure of clear diſcerning, what they are by Nature, and what they are made by the Grace of Chriſt; how they ought to live in this world, and what their duties are, the workings of their own luſts, and the Temptations of the Devil and World; the proneneſs and incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the heart to ſin, and cloſe up with Temptations, and the continual need they have of Divine aſſiſtance and protection;
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:44192:68"/>what need they have of the Mercy of God, and of the Blood and Righteouſneſs of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Moreover, their new light directs and leads them to Jeſus Chriſt, to own, receive, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept him for their Lord and Saviour, for their <hi>King, Prieſt,</hi> and <hi>Prophet;</hi> for their Head and Ruler, their Teacher and Lawgiver: and it is powerful to lead and perſwade them out of themſelves, to take up in Chriſt only, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.6. <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.12. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73.25, 26. <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.7.8. and it is powerful to take off their hearts and hands from ſin, ſelf-righteouſneſs, and ſelf-ability, from ſelf-boaſting, or glorying in ſelf, and from the enticing objects of this world. This new Divine Spiritual Light, ſees ſuch a tranſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent and ſingular beauty, excellency, and lovelineſs in the perſon, love and Grace of Chriſt, as to draw the Mind, Affections, and whole Soul to him, to lodge them in him, take up with him, greatly to love him, and cleave unto him; to deſire him and his Grace, and to chuſe and apply it to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. To adore and admire him, to honour and exalt him, to live and dye with him and for him; to live to him, and make it their work and buſineſs to pleaſe him; to ſpeak well of him, and to commend him, his Love and Grace to the acceptance and admiration of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, <hi>Cant.</hi> 5.9 <hi>ult.</hi> ſo likewiſe they ſee a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirable excellency and lovelineſs in the wills and commands of Chriſt, in their duty and Goſpel obedience to him, ſo as to fall in love with them and it; ſo as to obſerve and do what he commands, and that becauſe it is his holy
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:44192:68"/>Will, Gracious and Soveraign Pleaſure and Appointment that they ſhould ſo do: yea, and they can in meaſure diſcern when they pleaſe him, and when they do not, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.5. Beſides, Regenerate perſons have an experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental knowledge; they taſte, feel, and enjoy a part of the Heavenly matters which they ſee; they have the <hi>earneſt, and firſt Fruits</hi> of them in their hands; they have a part in poſſeſſion, namely, of Chriſt, his Grace, Spirit, Truth, and Heaven; and they begin to ſee thoſe things more diſtinctly and particularly; they can diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern one thing from another, and more and more look into the nature, property, uſe, and end of them, and how to uſe and improve them to the glory and praiſe of God, and to the comfort and edification of their own Souls.</p>
               <p>Secondly, another of theſe new ſpiritual ſenſes, is <hi>Taſting.</hi> The natural Man hath the ſenſes of ſeeing, and taſting things that are ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to him, ſo hath the ſpiritual man or new creature. <hi>O taſte and ſee that the Lord is graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, Pſal.</hi> 34.8. <hi>And if you have taſted that the Lord is gracious,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.3. It is a ſpiritual ſenſe or taſte, and they are ſpiritual things that it can taſte and reliſh. I ſhall briefly name ſome of them, to help you in your tryal, or in the proving and examining your ſtate and condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions by them.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>The word of God,</hi> Goſpel Precepts and Promiſes. The one declaring what God and Chriſt the Mediator, and holy Ghoſt, hath and will do for us: the other, what is our Duty, and what we ſhould do for God. Theſe words
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:44192:69"/>of God are exceeding ſweet and pleaſant to the ſpiritual taſte of new Creatures, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19.10. <hi>They are</hi> (ſays <hi>David) ſweeter than the honey, or honey Comb.</hi> So in the 119. <hi>Pſal.</hi> And <hi>Jeremy</hi> tells us the ſame <hi>Chap.</hi> 15.16. <hi>Thy words were found, and I did eat them, and thy word was unto me the joy and rejoycing of my heart.</hi> So is the word of God to thee if thou art a new Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, eſpecially at ſometimes, but it is not ſo to others. Chriſt calls his Fathers will, his food. <hi>My Meat</hi> (ſays he) <hi>is to do the will of him that ſent me; and man liveth not by bread onely, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God, Matth.</hi> 4. Well, what canſt thou ſay of and to this for thy ſelf?</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>The good Counſels, Exhortations, Admonitions, and Reproofs of Chriſtian friends, and Reſolutions, are ſweet to thy taſte alſo,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 25.32, 33. <hi>verſes,</hi> compared with the foregoing verſes; And <hi>David</hi> ſaid, <hi>bleſſed be thou of the Lord, and bleſſed be thy advice.</hi> Oh! how ſweet was a Womans Counſel and Admonition unto <hi>David,</hi> although he was much her Superiour. It is the ſame (in meaſure) with thee, if thou art a Rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate perſon. Oh! thou wilt receive, reliſh, and eat ſuch friendly words of Counſel and Advice, and bleſs God for them, and not quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel and cenſure thy friends for what they do, but receive and eat it as ſweet and wholeſome food for thy Soul, and give God and them thanks.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Ordinances.</hi> The Goſpel Ordinances, and holy Appointments of Chriſt, will be, and are indeed ſweeter to thy Taſte than any worldly
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:44192:69"/>thing. The Ordinances of Preaching, and hearing the Goſpel, are as the Goſpel to thee, <hi>ſweeter than hony to thy mouth, Pſal.</hi> 119.103. So are the other Ordinances to, the <hi>Lords Supper, Baptiſm, Prayer, ſinging of Pſalms,</hi> and <hi>Church-Fellow-ſhip.</hi> The <hi>Order and Diſcipline of Chriſt in the Church,</hi> and all other his Goſpel appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>The Lord Jeſus Chriſt is moſt Sweet unto their Taſts. As he is the faireſt of ten Thouſands, and altogether Lovely, Cant.</hi> 5.10. <hi>ult.</hi> ſo he is the ſweeteſt and moſt pleaſant of all things to the Taſt; yea, altogether ſweet; if his fruit be ſo, much more is he himſelf; But his fruit, the dropping of his Grace, is ſo, <hi>Cant.</hi> 2.3. How much more ſweet muſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf be unto Believers, who is the Root and fountain of all thoſe drops or friuts, <hi>Zach.</hi> 13.1. <hi>Revel.</hi> 22.16. Chriſt is the deſire of all theſe new ſenſes, as he is ſaid to be of <hi>all Nations; Habak.</hi> 2.7. And he is moſt deſirable to the Taſt; <hi>He is the bread of Life, that came down from Heaven; Which is meat indeed: for he that eateth of this bread, ſhall live for ever, Joh.</hi> 6.48.50.51.55. Chriſt is the moſt pretious, deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, ſweet bread, that ever any did eat; It hath ſuch a pleaſant reliſh, ſavour, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forting quality, it doth ſo refreſh and cheriſh the Soul of a Child of God, as that he greatly diſires it, longs after it, Covets to get and keep it, and (as it were) impatiently ſeeks and waits for it: It is ſo good as that it will never ſurfeit him; all other things how good and pleaſant ſoever they be, are nothing to him
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:44192:70"/>without this. This is the great diſh that makes the Word, Ordinances, and all other diſhes, a feaſt indeed; 'Tis that which reliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es and makes all other food ſweet, nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, excellent, and delightful. Hence they cry out in the fullneſſe of all other things (if they find not Chriſt there) Oh! where is Chriſt, let him come into my Garden, my Soul, the beſt and only diſh that ſhould feaſt us and ſatisfy us, is not here, till he come, I cannot eat, nor be Satisfyed, <hi>Cant.</hi> 4. <hi>ult.</hi> Saith a gracious heart. Let Chriſt be my bread, and I ſhall be fully ſatisfyed, <hi>he is my all, in all things, Coll.</hi> 3.11. and without him I cannot, may not, will not be ſatisfyed. Oh! give me Chriſt in all, or I dye, for my Soul will Wither and famiſh, whatever elſe I have, whatever elſe I feed upon. But Chriſt alone (if it ſo pleaſe him) will ſatiſfy me, though he give me no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>Experiences</hi> are ſweet and pleaſant to the Taſte; They are invaluable mercies: when new Creatures <hi>can bring forth out of their Treaſures new and old experiences,</hi> and ſay this and that I have found; This Aſſiſtance I have found in ſuch a duty, and that comfort I have found in that duty; In ſuch a ſtrait I found ſuch and ſuch ſeaſonable helps, ſupports and deliverances; When I was ſad, I found God comforting me; In doubt of my ſtate, I found God ſaying to me, <hi>be of good chear, thy Sins are forgiven thee.</hi> When my heart was hardened by Sin, he melted it, and when much ſtraitened and ſhut up, he enlarged it; when the guilt
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:44192:70"/>of my Sins lay heavy on my Conſcience, he applyed the blood of the everlaſting Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.20 and ſo relieved and eaſed me, and when I thought he was angry with me, and had ſhut out my Prayers, he anſwered them. Oh how ſweet are theſe and ſuch like experiences to the Taſt of new creatures. I could give you an account of many more had I time.</p>
               <p>This ſpiritual ſenſe hath a thirſting appetite. It is always with accompanied a hungering and thirſting Appetite after all Spiritual and Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly things that he knows, or thinks may be good for him; he hungers and thirſts after Chriſt, his Blood, Grace, Righteouſneſs, Ordinances, Word, Experiences, Heaven, and the preſence of Chriſt; and when he findes them, Oh how ſweet, comfortable and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing are they? Then he ſaith, <hi>now is my Soul ſatisfyed as with marrow and fatneſs, my Soul ſhall praiſe thee with joyful Lips, Pſal.</hi> 63.5.</p>
               <p n="2">2. As he Taſts, and hath a hungring and thirſting appetite after Spiritual things; ſo it loaths and nauſiates the Sins, vanities and follies that he once delighted in, and fed himſelf withal: he can neither taſt nor digeſt them; they are no waies toothſome to him, but odious, hateful, and abominable; They are now as filthy poyſon to him; As meat wherwith a man hath ſurfeited himſelf, is to him, ſo are theſe Sins and vanities unto a new Creature; They are all like naſty ſtink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Carrion to him; he abhorrs the ſight, ſmell and taſte of them, and cannot endure
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:44192:71"/>they ſhould be nigh him. The very thoughts of them are grievous to him, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. <hi>Ro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>.</hi> 7. They ſhall be no more his food, but loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: They were never ſo ſweet, as now they are bitter to him, 1 <hi>Jer.</hi> 2.19. They were once his pleaſant Bread, but now his bitter Poyſon; They were his Suger and Honey, wherewith he was delighted, but now they are Gall and Wormwood to him; His ſtomack raiſes up againſt them and he can no more endure them, nor be reconciled to them.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>Feeling.</hi> Feeling is another Senſe of the new Creature; For as the natural man hath the Senſe of feeling what doth touch, or burden it, ſo hath the new Creature the like Senſe too. The new creatures feeling ſenſe is ſenſible of, and burdened with many evils, weights and oppreſſions, that he is afflicted withal. But firſt, <hi>not with the Yoke and Service of Chriſt.</hi> The Old man indeed is greatly burde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with it, and complaines ſadly of the tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs and weariſomneſs of it, <hi>Mal.</hi> 1.13. and <hi>when will the Sabboth be gone, Amos</hi> 8.5. But the new Creature is not afflicted with, nor weary of it; but findes it and accounts it as the Scripture reports it to be, namely, an <hi>Eaſy and light Yoke, Math.</hi> 11. <hi>ult. And her way are ways of pleaſantneſs, Pro.</hi> 3.17. And <hi>his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments are not grievous,</hi> 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.3. Yea, they find <hi>that in keeping of them,</hi> or the right obſerving of them, <hi>is great reward, Pſal.</hi> 19.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Neither is the Chaſtiſing and afflicting will of God,</hi> as ſuch, their burden, or the real bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:44192:71"/>of the new Creature. For that is ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed up in the will of God, and that over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ballances all, becauſe it is the will of God who loves him, and he loves God. It is mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of joy to him that the will of God is done, although he ſuffer under it. And the new crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture knows that it is but a Fatherly chaſtiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; The fruit of great love, Care, wiſdom and Faithfulneſs; not to hurt him, but profit him; not to wound, but to heal the man; not to deſtroy, but to ſave him, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.28. <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 27.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But in the ſecond place, <hi>the new Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is ſenſible of, afflicted, burdened and oppreſſed with other matters.</hi> As 1. his <hi>Luſts</hi> and <hi>Sins.</hi> Theſe are the heavy burdens that preſſe him down, and makes him cry out (with <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>David</hi>) <hi>O wretched man that I am, who ſhall deliver me from the Body of this Death, Rom.</hi> 7.24. And with Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid, <hi>There is no reſt in my Bones, by reaſon of my Sin, Pſal.</hi> 38. and <hi>who can underſtand his errors, Cleans thou me from my Sins, Pſal.</hi> 19. <hi>and Pſal.</hi> 51. There are many of them of his unbelief, earthly-mindedneſs, covetouſneſs, deſires af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter worldly things, hypocriſy, formality, and too often indifferency and lukewarmneſs of Spirit in the worſhip of God. His deadneſs and careleſneſs. Robbing God and his ſoul of their due. Aptneſs and Proneſs of heart to cloſe up and fall in with temptation to Sin. His Paſſion, Anger, Wrath, Peeviſhneſs, Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, Frothyneſs, Carnal Security, depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the heart from God and Duty, and an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſneſs to it; to envy and grudge at others

Alſo its hardneſs of heart, &amp; unprofitableneſs under the means of Grace, and unuſefulneſs in the world. Theſe and many other luſts and ſins are its bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens, they oppreſs &amp; preſs him down. Theſe are the Mountains that lay on the back of the new Creature, and it earneſtly longs for, and deſires deliverance from them all. Moreover, they are greatly burdened with the Treachery, and deceitfulneſs of their hearts; their fears, doubts, and diſtractions in duty, their want of heavenly mindedneſs, love to God, delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in him, and his ſervice. They are bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened, and ſmart under the ſenſe of the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purity of their hearts, and great inſenſibility of Mercies, and becauſe God is not honoured and glorified by them as he ſhould be. They are burdened, becauſe their Luſts are ſo ſtrong and powerful, as that when they would do good, they cannot; And as they are burden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with theſe and many other Evils of their own, ſo they feel a great weight in others ſins likewiſe. <hi>Rivers of waters run down their Eyes, becauſe other men are Tranſgreſſors of Gods I am,</hi> Pſal. 119.136. And (ſays <hi>Paul) who is weak, and I am nor weak,</hi> 2 Cor. 11.29. <hi>And ye are puffed up, and have not rather Mourned,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.2.

Now they are burdened, wounded, and bleed under the ſenſe of wicked mens pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaneneſs, debauchery, and contempt of the Goſpel of Chriſt. But they are moſtly wounded with the evils and miſcarriages of Profeſſours, and ſuch as they hope are the People of God. Their <hi>Pride, Worldlineſs, Frothyneſs, Back-bitings, negligence and careleſneſs</hi> in the matters of God, their <hi>cenſorious and raſh Judgings</hi> of one another, their want of Love, Kindneſs, and Charity to each other, and their brawlings and conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions one with another, and their coldneſs and lukewarmneſs in Religion, with other their ſins, do deeply wound and pierce them to the heart, and that becauſe they are a ſhame and diſhonour to their Father, Husband, and Head, his Name and People, and becauſe him whom they love and honour, is not glorifyed in and by them. And further, as they are burdened and wounded with other ſins and miſcarriages, ſo likewiſe, with the <hi>Reproaches</hi> and other ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings of good Men. <hi>Who is afflicted and I burn not,</hi> (ſays <hi>Paul</hi>) 2 Cor. 11.29. Their Brethrens <hi>Bonds are their Bonds, Heb.</hi> 13.3. their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches, Pains, Loſſes, Poverty, Weakneſſes, and Perſecutions, are their own. They are in Pain, Bonds, Poverty, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> with them; They have Spirits to <hi>rejoyce with them that rejoyce, and weep with them that weep, Rom.</hi> 12.15, 16. And it muſt needs be ſo, becauſe they are Fellow-Members of the ſame Spiritual Body, joyned to Chriſt their Head; and if they are not ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathizers with, and Fellow-feelers of each
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:44192:73"/>others Afflictions, it is certain they are not living, but dead Members, whatever they profeſs themſelves to be, or pretend to, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.25, 26, 27. (read and ponder that Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.)</p>
               <p>New Creatures have a feeling of many other Burdens alſo. The Temptations of the Devil, ſnares and allurements of the world, are their heavy and grievous Burdens. They grown under them, and earneſtly deſire to be deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from them. They find by woful experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that the Devil ſhoots his <hi>Fiery Darts</hi> at them, and labours Night and Day by his <hi>Wiles,</hi> to draw them from God, and to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangle them in Sin, <hi>Eph.</hi> 6.

The Lord Jeſus knows how dangerous and pernicious the good things of this world would be to his diſciples Souls, and therefore charges them to take heed, and beware of them, leſt at any time, (Mark it) <hi>leſt at any time you be inſnared with them, Luk.</hi> 21.34.</p>
               <p n="2">2. As the feeling ſenſe is ſenſible of ſmarts, and cries out under the burdens and weights of theſe evils, ſo, it is deeply ſenſible of the great love and Grace of Chriſt to him; he is heartily affected with his <hi>Rich mercy, Eph:</hi> 2.<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. <hi>and the unſearchable Riches of</hi> Gods Grace to him. Evil and good, Grace and Sin, affect him; he is not onely deeply ſenſible of what he is, and hath done to God, but what God is to, and hath done for him; he is affected with the beſt things as well as the worſt; with matters of joy, as well as ſorrow; he hath his Eye as well on the bright ſide of the Cloud, as on the dark ſide of it; and he is impreſſed with Gods goodneſs and holyneſs, as well as with his own badneſs and vileneſs; he takes in one as well as another, and both make powerful impreſſion on his feeling Senſe. The ſame Senſe is capable of joy and
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:44192:74"/>Sorrow, and there are in his view, ſuitable objects and matters for both; and he is real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſenſible of both. But I haſten.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, <hi>Hearing.</hi> New Creatures have a new Senſe of Hearing. The hearing Senſe is appointed and given to men, to receive and take in <hi>words</hi> ſpoken, without which they know not what is ſpoken to them. Now as men have the natural ſenſe of hearing, ſo Regenerate Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons have a new <hi>ſpiritual ſenſe</hi> of hearing given them in Regeneration; until then they are ſaid to be <hi>Deaf, Pſal.</hi> 58.4. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 42.18, 19. al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they had not loſt their natural Senſe of hearing; yet the Scripture ſaith, they were Deaf; why, becauſe they had not Spiritual Ears to hear; hence the Lord Jeſus (ſpeaking to the <hi>Aſian</hi> Churches) bids ſuch as had <hi>Eares to hear, what the Spirit ſpake unto them; Revel.</hi> 2. <hi>and</hi> 3. Chapters. Clearly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying that there were ſome among them, that had not this Spiritual Senſe of hearing the Voice of the holy Spirit, but that there were others that had it. And the Prophet tells the Jews that there were ſome that had <hi>Eares, but were Deaf, Iſa.</hi> 43.8. that is, they had the natural, but not the Spiritual ſenſe of hearing the voice of God by his Prophets. This Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual hearing ſenſe imports, not onely a hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and taking in the words or matters they hear, but alſo underſtanding them, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving them into the underſtanding, will, and affection, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 40.3.4. 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.10. <hi>Pro.</hi> 7.1. <hi>Pro.</hi> 10 14. They are ready and <hi>ſwift to hear, Jam.</hi> 1.19.21. Let Chriſt ſpeak to
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:44192:74"/>them what he will, they can and will hear him; <hi>Speak Lord, for thy ſervant heares,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 3.2. is the language of his heart; and <hi>Lord what wilt thou have me to do, Acts.</hi> 9. doth God or good men, inſtruct, admoniſh, exhort, reprove, charge, rebuke them, their Eares and hearts are open and ready to hear and receive it, to love and underſtand it; to keep and practice it, or to improve all to the will of God. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate Perſons are the <hi>good ground hearers; Luk.</hi> 8.15. <hi>Math.</hi> 13. They have Eares to hear, hearts to receive and underſtand what is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed to them; yea, to keep and hold it faſt; convert the word into profit, and turn all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the practice of Godlyneſs. They, and they only have learnt the myſtery and Spiritual Art of hearing: They are the only Wiſe, Seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, Humble, Diligent, Circumſpect, Careful, Reverend, Watchful, Sincere, Profitable and good Hearers. They are taught to pleaſe and honour God better, and advantage their own Souls in and by hearing. They are the Perſons (and none but they) who hear in hearing; who do truely and faithfully endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to hear Chriſt, in hearing of men; and to <hi>hear that voice behind them, ſaying, this is the way, walk ye in it;</hi> which is promiſed in <hi>Iſa:</hi> 30.20.21. They are the men who do indeed make bleſſed earnings of hearing, and who do unfainedly intend, deſign and carry on right, high and holy ends in hearing, namely, to know Chriſt, his Will, Grace, Spirit, Benefits, Covenant, and Promiſes; to know themſelves, their Sins, Deceits, and Errors; their increaſe
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:44192:75"/>or decreaſe in Grace and practical Godlineſs, and to know how they ought to believe and carry themſelves towards God and men in all conditions, States and Relations, better, more clearly and Spiritually, that ſo they may <hi>walk worthy of the Lord, unto all well-pleaſing, and be fruitful in every good work; adorn the Goſpel of Chriſt,</hi> and beautify their holy profeſſion. Theſe are the men who hear, that they may be cleanſed and waſhed, that they may be quickened to, and ſtrengthened in their duty, and that their luſts may be deſtroyed by the word of Grace, <hi>Joh.</hi> 15.3. <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.17. <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.25.26. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.4.5. And that they may, as in the Lords own way and appointment, meet with Chriſt, and Chriſt with them, to expreſs their dependance on, and ſubjection to him, and that they <hi>may be filled with all the fulneſs of God, Eph.</hi> 3.19. This is the hearing Ear, and underſtanding heart, that is rarely to be found in the world.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, <hi>Smelling.</hi> In the natural body there is the Senſe of Smelling, ſo there is in the new Creature alſo; Chriſt is full of ſweet ſmells and Savours, fitted and ſuited to a believers new ſenſe; and Chriſt hath provided for, and given them a ſenſe capable of receive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and reſenting it, which adds much to their ſtrength and Comfort, and renders the Lord Jeſus more ſweet, lovely, and acceptable to them. For the more ſenſes they have to draw and take in of Chriſts Perſon, Grace, and lovelyneſs to themſelves, the more they get from Chriſt, and the more pleaſing and
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:44192:75"/>deſirable he muſt needs be to them; had the patural man only two or three ſenſes, to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend and take in objects, and the good of them, his life would not be ſo comfortable; becauſe as then, many of the Creatures would be vain and uſeleſs to him, ſo he would live without the uſe and comfort of them that are ſuited to the ſenſes he wants, and which he cannot receive nor take comfort and delight in, without them. And men are naturally beſt pleaſed, and moſt ſatisfyed with variety of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects and matters. It is much more ſo in Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual and heavenly matters and things, Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual men, love and delight much in heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>varieties,</hi> and therefore to delight and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfy them, to endear their Souls to Chriſt, and incourage them in their Duty to him, he hath given them many ſenſes or ſubjects ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of apprehending and taking in variety of heavenly matters and things; and that is not all, but he hath alſo graciouſly provided all ſuitable varieties for them, and preſents them freely to their acceptance. Thus Chriſt is to them, <hi>a ſweet ſmelling Savour, Eph.</hi> 5.2. his death was ſo to God, and his Perſon, Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and Benefits, are ſo to them, <hi>Cant.</hi> 5.13.2.13. Their Perſons love and obedience are a <hi>ſweet ſmelling ſavour</hi> to Chriſt, <hi>Cant.</hi> 4.10.11. And ſo is Chriſt unto them, <hi>Cant.</hi> 1.3. and it is powerful to excite and draw forth their ſtrongeſt and deareſt love to Chriſt, <hi>Becauſe of the ſavour of this good Oyntments; therefore do the Virgins love thee.</hi> And as it excites and draws forth their love to Chriſt, ſo it gladdens and
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:44192:76"/>refreſhes the hearts of new Creatures. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 45.8. <hi>All thy Garments ſmell of Myrth, &amp;c. whereby they have made thee glad.</hi> Thus I have briefly run over, and preſented you a few conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the New Creature, his ſpiritual ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, what they are, and of their nature, work, uſe, and end; to help you to make a true Judgment of your ſelves, whether you are new Creatures indeed, or only in name and pretence.</p>
               <p>And be aſſured of this, that if thou art in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed a Regenerate perſon, thou mayeſt in ſome degree, (eſpecially at ſometimes) find theſe ſpiritual ſenſes in thee. And if thou canſt find them in any degree in thee, thou mayeſt conclude, that thou art a Child of God, and really Regenerate. For it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that unregenerate perſons have them not in them, but are real ſtrangers, if not Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to them; and ſuch as regard them not, neither do they find them in any degree or meaſure in themſelves, they are in an unrege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate ſtate and condition. And that they have not theſe ſenſes, is evident; for they are dead, blind, hard, and wholly carnal, as hath been ſhewed already. And ſo much of the firſt Mark or Character of a new Creature, I ſhall briefly diſpatch the reſt, and then pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to other heads propounded.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>If thou art a new Creature indeed, thou haſt been brought forth, and born again in pain, and with grief and trouble of Soul.</hi> Every natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Child is brought forth with ſorrow and pain, <hi>Joh.</hi> 16. and every <hi>n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>w-born Babe</hi> is brought
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:44192:76"/>forth with ſorrow and pain. The Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus hath been in Travail, Sorrow, and Pain for them that are and ſhall be regenerated, to purchaſe their new Birth, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.3.11. he had the hardeſt labour and ſtrugling for thee; he was in the greateſt and moſt dreadful <hi>Agony</hi> and anguiſh of Soul that could be, to procure thy Regeneration and new State; he had many a woful and grievous throw; many a ſigh and groan, and he <hi>ſweat many drops of Blood</hi> for thee, when he was Sacrificing his life to Divine Juſtice for thy Redemption and Sanctification, to Redeem thee from thy old ſtate of Sin and Miſery, <hi>Luk.</hi> 22.44. <hi>Math.</hi> 26. and to make thee one of his <hi>peculiar people, Tit.</hi> 2.14. <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. And as he hath been in Pain and Travail for thee, ſo (if thou art Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generated) he hath given thee a ſmall Taſte of his Pains and Sorrows in thy birth. Thou haſt not been brought forth without ſighs, groans, throws, Pains and Sorrows, no, but thou haſt found much Strugling, and many pangs of heart. It is true, that all Children are not born with the ſame degree and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of pains and ſorrows. Some Women feel more, ſome leſs, in their Travail, but all have ſome. <hi>In Sorrow thou ſhalt bring forth Children,</hi> ſays God, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.16. ſo he ſays of all ſinners that he will Regenerate, (if grown perſons) in ſorrow ſhalt thou be Regenerated, and made a New Creature. Thou ſhalt taſte and feel what an evil and bitter thing it is to be a ſinner, and under my Wrath, the dominion of Luſts and the Devil; <hi>That thou hast forſaken
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:44192:77"/>me the Fountain of living Waters, Jer.</hi> 2. Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led againſt me, thrown off my Yoke, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyed the Devil rather than me. Thou ſhalt know that I have obſerved all thy contemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous ſlightings of my Son, my Grace and Mercy, and cauſing me to ſtand, wait, and knock for thee, and thoud'ſt not hearken to me. When God Regenerates men, he lets looſe Sin, Guilt, Devil, his Law and Venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance on the Souls and Conſciences of ſuch for a time, and the Spirit of God, who is the great <hi>Agent</hi> in Regenerating them, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.5. makes himſelf as a Spirit of Bondage to them, and ſeemingly to their own ſenſe, puts them into, and leaves them in a far worſe caſe and condition than they were in before, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.15. ſo that now their ſinful peace, carnal ſecurity, vain and fooliſh hopes and confidences are all broken and ſhattered, and they are left to the wide world to ſhift for themſelves, and that when they are encompaſſed about with fears and miſeries, and have none to comfort them, but are like men ſhut up in doubts, fears, and diſtractions, not knowing what to do, nor what to think of their conditions. They are condemned by the Law, and their own Conſciences, and they ſee themſelves bound over to anſwer for all their Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions at the Judgment Seat of God. They ſee themſelves in ſtraits and miſeries, and know not how to help themſelves, neither can they find any that will or can; for they look upon God as their Enemy, and are afraid of him. This makes them cry out, O, <hi>What
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:44192:77"/>ſhall we do to be ſaved?</hi> How, or by whom ſhall we be delivered? <hi>Acts</hi> 2.37. <hi>Acts</hi> 16.29, 30. Now their Hearts, Heads, and Souls are in travelling pains and pangs, greatly longing to be delivered, like men that are ſinking into the bottom of the Sea, and never like to be ſaved. Thus they are brought forth in pain and Sorrow. And God hath many wiſe and grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ends in dealing thus with them, which in due time they ſhall ſee, and bleſs him for. For by bringing forth the new <hi>Creature,</hi> thus he greatly imbitters Sin to them, ſhews them their own vileneſs, weakneſs, and wretchedneſs, and cauſes them to loath themſelves, and hate their Sin, endears and commends Jeſus Chriſt, his Grace and love to them, and ſtirs them up to ſeek after him, and cleave to him the more ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly and heartily.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The <hi>new Creature</hi> is of a <hi>humble, meek and lowly nature;</hi> it is like the Father and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour of it, the Lord Jeſus; <hi>he was meek and lowly in heart and life, Math.</hi> 11.29. Chriſt was of a <hi>Lamb-like, Dove-like</hi> nature, Spirit and Carriage in his life and Death. In his life, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.29. <hi>Behold the Lamb of God.</hi> In his death, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der exceeding great contemps, &amp; innumerable Injuries; <hi>he was as a Lamb, Acts.</hi> 8.32. ſo his Saints are often called his Sheep and Lambs; <hi>My ſheep hear my voice, Joh.</hi> 10.27. and his <hi>Lambs, Joh.</hi> 21.15. ſo he calls them his <hi>Doves, C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>nt.</hi> 2.14. <hi>Cant.</hi> 5.2. and ſo they call Chriſt, <hi>Cant.</hi> 5.12. now, who knows not theſe Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures to be meek, lowly, and humble; and becauſe they are generally known ſo to be and
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:44192:78"/>are ſo in their own nature, the Lord Jeſus ſets out and ſhews us what his new Creatures are in their natures and carriages by them; and they are ſuch indeed, or they are not the real Sheep, Lambs, and Doves of the Lord Jeſus; for all his People participate of his nature; they are of Poor, Meek, Humble, and lowly Spirits, Words, and Carriages, in meaſure like their head Chriſt, how Proud and Lofty ſo e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver they were before. Chriſts Regenerating Grace is certainly Soul-humbling, Spirit-meekening, and Heart-debaſing Grace where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it is. It Turns <hi>Lyons</hi> into <hi>Lambs, Wolves</hi> into <hi>Sheep,</hi> and Ravenous Birds into ſweet Doves; For they are Regenerated with the <hi>divine nature,</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.4. and by the <hi>Spirit of Chriſt, Rom.</hi> 8.9. and they are ſaid to be, <hi>as he is, in the world,</hi> 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.17.</p>
               <p>And as they are ſo by nature, or there new birth, ſo likewiſe by their <hi>Light and conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</hi> Their habits are improved and ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened by their own endeavours, as by Gods own Proper means. 1. They ſee ſo much of their own Vileneſs, Wretchedneſs, Nakedneſs, and Impotency, as to make them loath them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; and they ſee ſo much of their former and paſt Tranſgreſſions and Sins, as to cauſe them to abhor and condemn themſelves, <hi>Job.</hi> 42. They do now ſee themſelves and ways, with another kind of light and judgment than they did before, ſo that now their Self-juſtifying is turn'd into Self-condemning; and their high thoughts, into low and Self-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſing thoughts of themſelves. They were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:44192:78"/>ſo high in their own Eyes, as now they are low; and never ſo worthy and ſufficient, as now they are unworthy, and nothing, <hi>Phill.</hi> 3.7.2. They ſee (in meaſure) the holyneſs and Righteouſneſs of God and his Laws, and the great unſuitableneſs of their hearts and wayes unto them; and the ſight and Senſe thereof, greatly humbles and debaſes them, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 6.5. <hi>Job.</hi> 42.5.6. And as they are hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled and debaſed at the ſight and knowledg of theſe things, ſo alſo their ſerious pondering and conſidering them doth further ſhame, humble, and abuſe them. They do conſider, and lay theſe things to heart; and do not content themſelves with the bare knowing and apprehending them as true; no, but they ſearch into them, and apply them to themſelves; Thus and thus am I; This and this have I done, and this and that is my Sin and wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, my evil and miſery; and this and much more have I merrited, of the wrath and dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful vengeance of God, by my wickedneſs and rebellion, by my often refuſing his Yoke, and rejecting his grace and favour proferred to me in and by the Goſpel; ſo likewiſe the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of the holyneſs and Righteouſneſs of God, and his Laws and ways, which I have deſpiſed, ſlighted and ſet at nought, <hi>Pro.</hi> 1.24.25. and which I find I cannot cloſe up with, nor conform unto. Oh I have robbed him of his due, and am likely to do ſo ſtill, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the naughtineſs of my heart, and wickedneſs of my nature, which is moſt loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome and abominable throughout, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16.

By theſe and other ſuch conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations, their meek and humble natures are ſtrengthned and improved againſt the ſurg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Waves of Pride, and ſelf-exalting that is in them, and that ſtrives to overcome and conquer them.</p>
               <p>And as Regenerate perſons are meek, hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and lowly, by their Spiritual birth or new nature, and by their divine light and conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, do improve and augment it, as hath been ſhewed; ſo this truth may further ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, (namely, that Regenerate men are ſuch as hath been ſaid) by the <hi>Names and Titles</hi> the Holy Ghoſt gives them in Scripture. They are called the <hi>Meek of the Earth, Zeph.</hi> 2.3. that is, the onely meek men that live in this world, and that from their new nature and heavenly birth, their thoughts of themſelves, and their ſingular carriages and walkings before and towards God and men. This Appellation is often given them in Scripture, to diſtinguiſh them from other men, how good natur'd ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver they are; and to declare and ſhew forth their new natures and ſingular frames, carria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges and diſpoſitions; to manifeſt how God looks on and accounts them, and to provoke them to carry themſelves accordingly before all men, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 22.26. <hi>The meek ſhall eat and be ſatiſfyed:</hi> and <hi>the meek will he guide in judgment;</hi>

They are low and vile in their own Eyes; they are nothing, yea, worſer than nothing in their own apprehenſions, and ſo are all their works and beſt performances alſo. Wherefore you, who think your ſelves new Creatures, or to be Regenerated and born a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, ſhould examine your ſelves whether or no you are indeed under this Character, if you have this certain and undeniable <hi>Mark</hi> of Chriſts ſheep on you? For if you have it not, you are not as yet Regenerated, you are not the real ſheep of Chriſt, but you are ſtill in your old ſinful ſtates and conditions, and you ſhall certainly periſh except you be born again. There are very many Perſons, who have gotten light in their Heads, many con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victions and much trouble of Spirit; have reformed their lives, and walk with the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God: who are ſo far from being more ſweet, humble and meek, in and by their light, Reformation, and ſuppoſed change of ſtate, as that they are more high and lofty then they were. In this Senſe they are Changed from leſs to more Pride, from Sin to Sin in a higher degree. They are greater in their own Eyes, and more haughty in their words and deport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments than they were before their Reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; which clearly and infallably ſhews that they are not as yet partakers of the Divine na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:44192:80"/>or Spirit of Chriſt: but though they have put on ſheeps cloathing, yet they are ravening wolves within. I have known many who took up a ſeeming true profeſſion and practice of Godlineſs, with much Pride and high thoughts of themſelves, and a low and baſe eſteem of others, (poſſibly better then themſelves) but none of them proved ſound, and Regenerate perſons, but at long run, they withered away and came to nothing, or worſe than nothing. And when I find per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons (eſpecially young ones) under convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of, and trouble for ſin (as they ſay) en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring after the way to Heaven, and reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their lives, without evident humble hearts, words, carriages and deportments: I cannot but fear what their ends will be. But know, that if you are Regenerate indeed, your Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation hath greatly, (though not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly) meekned, humbled and made you lowly minded.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, <hi>The frame and diſpoſition of the new Creature is ſet upon, and Reſolved to exalt and mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nify God, and the Lord Jeſus Christ.</hi> Men are prone to adore, exalt, and greaten ſomething or perſon, and becauſe they do not (by Nature) know or find any one Perſon or thing of bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter account and eſteem with them, then their carnal Self, they do make it their buſineſs to exalt, ſerve, and advance that, and take much delight in their ſo doing; but to exalt, ſerve and magnify God, they have no mind or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light.

But as Regeneration humbles men, and makes them vile in their one eies, ſo it greatly magnifies and exalts God the Father, and Jeſus Chriſt Mediator. It is not fained in or by them, but it is their very make, their frame, bent, and diſpoſition; It is natural to the new Creature to honour and magnify God, as it was before to the natural man to honour and magnify Self; Now they can be nothing, that Chriſt may be <hi>all, and in all things, Coll.</hi> 3.11. they can upon choice, be baſe and vile, that Chriſt many be honoured and exalted thereby. They can freely become the Foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtool of Chriſt, that he may be lifted up on high; they can be any thing (but ſinners) for the greatning of Chriſt, and ſetting him (as it were) on his Throne, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.20.</p>
               <p>The new Creature being of a heavenly make and Conſtitution, is wholly taken up with, and Swallowed up in Chriſt and his Intereſts. Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal ſelf is become a vile thing to that man who is indeed regenerated, in compariſon of Jeſus
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:44192:81"/>Chriſt, his Goſpel, Names, and Glory. Self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denial, and Chriſt exalting, is one of the firſt Leſſons he Learns, and the firſt work and concern he is buſied about. Aſſoon as <hi>Paul</hi> was regenerated, his heart was raiſed up to this duty, bent, and reſolvedly ſet upon it, and without delay proſecuted it. <hi>Lord</hi> (ſays he) <hi>what wilt thou have me to do, Acts.</hi> 9.6. and he tels us, that aſſoon as he knew his Lords will, he <hi>conſulted not with fleſh and blood,</hi> (that is, with ſelf eaſe and ſafety) no, but preſently fell to work, namely, to exalt Chriſt, ſave Souls, and enlarge his Maſters kingdome, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.15, 16. <hi>Paul</hi> did immediately joyn Iſſues with Chriſt, and free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and fully cloſed up with his Terms, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded by himſelf to all that will be his diſciples, <hi>Mark.</hi> 8.34. <hi>Luk.</hi> 14.26, 27. <hi>Luk.</hi> 18. and believe it, ſo it is with you, if you are <hi>his Diſciples indeed, Joh.</hi> 8.31. if <hi>you are born again of the Spirit, Joh.</hi> 3.5. Chriſt Jeſus the Lord, is pretious in your Eies, and high in your e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem; your Lives, Eſtates, Honours, Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, Dignities and Relations are ſmall matters to you, in compariſon of Chriſt, his name, Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, and Intereſts. And therefore your deſire, choice, deſign, aime, ſcope, and endeavours are all to greaten, magnify, and exalt him. As he is <hi>the fairest of ten thouſands</hi> unto you, ſo you deſire, chuſe, and labour that he may be ſo by you. It is a fixed principle in your hearts, a ſtated Caſe in your Judgments and Conſciences, and a ſetled frame and bent of your Souls. There is nothing in the World more pleaſing and acceptable to you, and there
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:44192:81"/>is not any thing that more refreſhes your mindes, and delights your hearts then this, that you have a Chriſt to Glorify, and that you may Glorify and Honour him.

One of the firſt queſtions or enquiries of the new Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is, how and wherein he may live to God, pleaſe and honour him, and bring forth fruit whereby he may be glorifyed, <hi>Joh.</hi> 15.8. it is the great caſe and intereſt their hearts and ſouls are concerned in, and they are grieved when they cannot reach it, but receive or count it matter of joy when he is really loved, honoured and exalted by any, eſpecially when they can do it themſelves. It is ſo natural to new Creatures, or Regenerate men, and they are ſo intereſſed in and with Jeſus Chriſt his concerns, as that they take and account what is done to or againſt him, is done to or againſt themſelves. They are like the Lord Jeſus their head in this too, Namely, that what i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> Chriſts Indignity, is theirs, and what is Chriſts glory and honour, is theirs alſo. His reproach and honour lays nearer their hearts then any or all their own Earthly and Bodily concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. The Lord Jeſus accounts his Peoples
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:44192:82"/>Reproaches, Indignities, Proſperity and Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, his own, ſuch is his great love and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects to, and care of them, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 63.9. <hi>Acts</hi> 9.5. <hi>Math.</hi> 10.42. <hi>Math.</hi> 25.40. <hi>Zach.</hi> 2.8.

Is his Name, Goſpel and Worſhip, under a cloud of contempt and reproach, it is matter of grief and mourning to them, and when they are loved, exalted, and dignifyed, it is their glory and joy, <hi>Phil.</hi> 5.17. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. And that it is ſo indeed, may farther be evidenced.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>From their near Relations.</hi> New Creatures or Regenerate men are the <hi>Children</hi> of God.

How much more doth the Divine nature and Spirit of God in Believers prompt and inſtigate them to do ſo to their heavenly Father, and that by all the wayes and means they may.</p>
               <p n="2">2. They are the <hi>Spouſes of the Lord Jeſus, and he is their Husband, Cant.</hi> 2.16. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.2. <hi>Jer.</hi> 3.14.

The Lord
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:44192:82"/>Jeſus Regenerates men, to make them capable of choſing him for theirs, and to make them meet for this <hi>Conjugal Relation.</hi> And they have in their hearts the love and reſpects (in part) that are due to ſuch a Relation as Chriſt is.</p>
               <p n="3">3. They are related to Chriſt <hi>as members to the head.</hi> He is their <hi>head, and they are his members, Eph.</hi> 5.23.30. And therefore they muſt needs have his nature and ſpirit, to deſire and natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally deſign, intend and indeavour to exalt and honour him. The members of the natural body do naturally honour their head, and the head doth the ſame to the members, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.26. So it is in the myſtical head and body. And it cannot but be ſo, becauſe of the one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and mutual ſimpathy that is between them. So then, if you are new Creatures, you are members of Chriſt, and if members of Chriſt, then you ſimpathize with Chriſt. His reproach is yours, and his honour is yours, and you have a natural frame, bent, and diſpoſition of heart, to honour, exalt, and magnify him all you can, and it is your delight &amp; joy to do it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Love, eſteem and reſpects,</hi> that are in theſe Relations, and flow from them to Chriſt, do <hi>prompt and ſtir</hi> you up to Deſire, Chuſe, Deſign and endeavour to honour and exalt him. Their ſtrong and endeared love to, and high eſteem of him, provokes and moves them to ſtudy, project, watch and labour all they can to pleaſe, honour, and exalt him. The love of ſo many near and great Relations, as they ſtand in to him, muſt needs be very ſtrong and fervent, being in one ſubject. They love
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:44192:83"/>and eſteem him as their loving, ſweet, and kind <hi>Head, Father, Husband,</hi> as their <hi>Redeemer, Teacher, Comforter, Crowner,</hi> and <hi>Eternal Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our,</hi> and therefore they cannot but ſeek, and endeavour his honour and exaltation. They have eyes enlightned, to ſee a tranſcendent Worth, and glorious Excellency, Beauty, and Majeſty in Chriſt, and they ſee him, <hi>As worthy of all Acceptation,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.15. ſo of all glory and exaltation. Neither Chriſt or his Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies are hid from them; but the Glory of them do ſo ſhine into their hearts, as greatly to draw forth their Hearts, Tongues, and Souls, to magnify and honour him, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 103.1.2. <hi>Cant.</hi> 5.10.—<hi>ult.</hi> They lay a <hi>Charge</hi> on themſelves, and command (as it were) their all to bleſs and glorify him. Now, what can you ſay to this mark, Can you ſay it is ſo with you? do you find it in you? and do you experience it indeed, or do you not? can you ſay in deed and in Truth, that whatever the performance be, yet the frame, bent, choice, inclination, and diſpoſition of your hearts, and endevours of your hands, are fully and frequently ſet, and reſolved to exalt, ſerve, pleaſe and magnify the great God, and Jeſus Chriſt, your Lord and King, your Glory and Crown?</p>
               <p>Fifthly. <hi>The new Creature hath a hungring and thurſting deſire, and earneſt longing after Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> after Intereſt in and Communion with him; after a clearer and more diſtinct know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of him and acquaintance with him, and whatſoever is his: as his Lawes, Promiſes,
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:44192:83"/>Blood Graces, or what ever elſe they hear is in him or hath relation to, or proceeds from him. The new Creature is like <hi>Noahs</hi> Dove, that can reſt the ſole of its foot only on, and in this <hi>Ark</hi> of the <hi>Everlaſting Covenant;</hi> All o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Foundations are but broken Reeds, and Ropes of Sand to him. Chriſt and the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace, the faithfulneſs and All-ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency of God, are his only <hi>Anchor Holds,</hi> and Rocky Grounds, upon which he can reſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and on which he caſts and roles himſelf. The New Man is the only <hi>wiſe Builder,</hi> for he chuſes the <hi>Rock of Ages</hi> to Build upon, and none elſe, <hi>Math.</hi> 7.25. <hi>Math.</hi> 16.18. <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.7, 8. The Foundation which God hath laid in the Covenant of Grace for men to Build themſelves, their Faith and Hope upon, that they deſire, chuſe, hunger, and ſeek after, and cannot be ſatisfied without, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.11. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73.25, 26. The Regenerate perſons take up in reſt, build, and ſtay themſelves; <hi>The Lord is my Rock</hi> (ſays <hi>David</hi>) <hi>Pſal.</hi> 18.2. ſo ſays every New Creature, the Lord Jeſus Chriſt ſhall be my only Rock and Foundation; my hopes, notions, ſelf-righteouſneſs, good works and performances, my ſelf-ſuppoſed abilities, Profeſſions, Priviledges, and Reformations, ſhall no more be my Foundations as they have been; No, but Chriſt and the Covenant of Grace, the Faithfulneſs and All-ſufficiency of God, ſhall be my Foundation and reſting Place: I will build my ſelf, and all my hopes, confidences, and expectations, wholly and altogether on them; for they, and they only,
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:44192:84"/>can bare the weight of my Soul, and eternal Salvation, which I muſt build upon them. But unregenerate men have other bottoms and foundations to reſt and build themſelves upon; they little or nothing at all concern themſelves in good earneſt, with the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation God hath laid, but form a great many to themſelves, and build all their confidences, hopes, and expectations on them, and ſay, they are ſafe and ſecure, no evil ſhall come to them, <hi>Math.</hi> 7.26. Thus did the <hi>fooliſh Virgins, Math.</hi> 25.1.— and thus did <hi>Paul</hi> before his Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.6, 7. But it was otherwiſe after his Regeneration, then his whole Soul and mind was carried forth to Chriſt, with all poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible earneſtneſs and importunity, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.8. Their <hi>thouſand of Rams, and ten thouſand Rivers of Oyl,</hi> now, are nothing to them, as once they were, <hi>Micah.</hi> 6.7. no, but now ten thouſand of worlds for a ſure and certain bottom or foundation to reſt and build my poor ſhaken and toſſed Soul upon, is the voice and cry of all Regenerate men, before they clearly find Chriſt, ſo as to build upon him, and commit all their preſent and everlaſting concerns on him.</p>
               <p>And as they have a hungering and thirſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing deſire, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> after Chriſt for their foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation to build upon; ſo alſo to have him in their armes and hearts, to have more and clearer knowledg of, and intimate acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and communion with him. His abſence is grievous to them, but his preſence and favour, his ſmiles and acquaintance is <hi>better to
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:44192:84"/>them then Life, Pſal.</hi> 30.5. <hi>Pſal</hi> 4.6. They greatly deſire to ſee and know their glorious King arrayed with all his <hi>Royal Robes,</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching and comeing neare unto, and opening himſelfe unto them; to impart the ſecrets of his Love and Grace unto them, and thereby allure and draw them unto himſelf. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 63.1.2. <hi>Cant.</hi> 4. <hi>ult. Pſal.</hi> 25.14.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, A new Creature hath all holy Spiritual paſſions and affections. The natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral man (you know) hath many natural paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and affections, ſo the new man hath many Spiritual and heavenly paſſions and affections. The naturall man hath many evil and ſinful affections and paſſions, and the Spiritual man hath many divine and holy affections and paſſions. I ſhall name ſome, and but a few of them.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Love.</hi> As Regeneration makes men love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, acceptable and deſirable to God, Men and Angels, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16. ſo it makes them ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding loveing and affectionate men, to God and men. Before regeneration they are Self-lovers, Sin-lovers, and World-lovers, but by the new Nature and Spirit they have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from Heaven, they are no more ſuch, but God-lovers, Chriſt-lovers, Grace-lovers, Duty-lovers, and Saint-lovers. Now they have new affections for new objects and mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. They have operating Affections to and for God. They ſingle out God, Chriſt, and Holyneſs: they chuſe and ſingle out from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther objects and things, the Grace and Spirit, the Laws, Promiſes, People, and Ordinances
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:44192:85"/>of Chriſt, for their Love, and to ſet their ſtrongeſt, warmeſt, and heavenly Affections upon. The affections or paſſion of love in them, is ſtirred, Moved, Warmed, and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed by the Love of God, the Grace and Lovelineſs of Chriſt, that is declared and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented to them in and by the Goſpel. Oh how doth this paſſion ſomtimes work and act in them towards theſe objects and things. It is ſo full as that they are not able to vent or expreſs it, eſpecially when Chriſt appears to them, and puts in his hand (as it were) by the hole of the door (the heart) as that they can but ſigh and ſob, cry and weep out a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of this ſtrong and working affection. This did <hi>Mary Magdalen, Luk.</hi> 7.38. <hi>ſhe ſtood at his Feet weeping, and waſhed the feet of Chriſt with her Tears:</hi> but what was the ground of her ſo doing? ſee <hi>Verſe</hi> 47. why it was her ardent love and affection to Chriſt: ſhe did ſo, <hi>for ſhe loved much,</hi> namely Chriſt. Oh! what a ſtrong paſſion of love was ſhe in. How did her Affection work towards Chriſt? ſo likewiſe did <hi>Peters too, Joh.</hi> 12. <hi>Lord</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>thou knoweſt that I love thee;</hi> but how much or how ſtrong his love and affection to Chriſt was, he could not expreſs: <hi>David</hi> alſo gives us ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Teſtimony of it, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.97. <hi>Oh! how I Love thy Law:</hi> and elſewhere (ſayes he) <hi>I love them exceedingly.</hi> I do love them with a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and more affectionate love than I can ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs; and ſo was his love moved and drawn out to good men, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16.3.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="159" facs="tcp:44192:85"/>2. <hi>Hatred.</hi> Theſe are oppoſite and contrary paſſions in men, namely, Love and Hatred. In our unregenerate States we do Love what we ſhould hate, and hate what we ſhould Love. We Love Gods enemies, and hate his friends; we hate his Laws, Rods, Yoke, Waies, &amp; People, and love our Luſts, the World, Self, and the Service of ſin. But Regeneration ſets holy and God Pleaſing Love and hatred in us. So that now, by the power of his Regenerating Grace; we love that which we ſhould love, and hate that we ſhould hate; that which was our duty to have done before, now we can do. Now we can and do love holineſs, and hate, loath, and abhor our luſts and ſins. Now we hate the workes of the fleſh, and love the workes of the Spirit. And as the paſſion of love is ſtrong and intenſe on its Objects, ſo is this of hatred likewiſe. The man in whom this new holy hatred is, did never more really, heartily, and fervently love his luſts, and the fulfilling of them, than he doth now hate, abominate, and endeavour to deſtroy them, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. <hi>ult. Gal.</hi> 5.24. <hi>They that are Chriſts</hi> (namely, by Regeneration) <hi>have Crucified the fleſh with the Affections and Luſts. David</hi> tells us, that this Affection or Paſſion was ſtrong in him, as well as that of love, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.104.113. I <hi>hate every falſe way;</hi> and I <hi>hate vain thoughts, but thy Law do I love.</hi> Bleſſed <hi>Paul</hi> Speaks likewiſe to the ſame purpoſe of himſelf, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.15. <hi>But what I hate, that do I.</hi> I do ſin, its true; But I can ſay, that my ſin is the great and only Object of my hatred, that's as true alſo.

Theſe and ſuch like conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of ſin, greatly provokes and ſtirs up the holy hatred of ſin in all Regenerate men, as they can experience. There is in them a univerſal, perpetual, and irreconcilable hatred of all ſin, eſpecially ſuch of their own ſins as do <hi>more eaſily beſet them, Heb.</hi> 12.1. They hate the very name and appearance of ſin; all <hi>the Germents ſpotted with the fleſh, Jude</hi> 23.

               <p n="5">5. <hi>Joy.</hi> Joy is another holy paſſion in good men. There is the natural paſſion of joy in all men, and there is the Spiritual paſſion of joy in Regenerate men. There is the object or matter of joy, and there is the joy it ſelf, and alſo the faculty or ſubject of joy. The ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject or matters of joy and rejoycing to good men are Chriſt, Grace, and heavenly things,

This is given us of God the Father, Chriſt and the holy Spirit, as a ſpecial expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his Love and Grace to us. The objects of joy will not afford it until he give it, or <hi>command them to hand it out to us, Pſal.</hi> 133.3. <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.17. <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.13. <hi>Gall.</hi> 5.22. <hi>Joh.</hi> 14. <hi>Job.</hi> 15.11. <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.20. (3) There is the faculty or ſubject of joy, that is, that which is onely capable of receiving the impreſſions of the joy of the Lord in the Soul, and improving it aright. This is that we call the affection or paſſion of joy, and this is given to men namely, as it is a Spiritual or new paſſion in Regeneration. For thereby God makes them ſubjects capable of receiving and rightly em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing, valuing, and uſeing the heavenly joy he intends for, and hath promiſed to give unto them, in their walking with him in their Regenerate ſtates. Now they can and do <hi>rejoice in Chriſt Jeſus, Phill.</hi> 3.3. in his love and Grace, and in his will and their duty, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.22. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 40. now they <hi>praiſe God with

Their hearts are full of great and unſpeakable joy, at ſome ſeaſons, ſo as that their Veſſels can now hold no more, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.8. With this Holy Joy in their hearts, <hi>they can run, and not be weary, walk, and not faint, Iſa.</hi> 40. <hi>ult. Neh.</hi> 8.10.</p>
               <p n="6">6. <hi>Sorrow.</hi> This is in a ſenſe a contrary paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion or affection to that of Joy. There is a natural and carnal ſorrow, and a holy and ſpiritual ſorrow, or grief of heart; the firſt is common to all men, the ſecond is only found in Regenerate men. Sorrow in a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ſenſe is an evil, but in a ſpiritual ſenſe it is a good paſſion. Joy and ſorrow are ſtrong and vehement working paſſions in men, when ſtrongly impreſt, and deeply affected with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al or ſuppoſed evil or good. There is <hi>a worldly, and there is a godly ſorrow,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.10. Regeneration brings into, and ſets up the godly ſorrow in men, and thereby they are enabled <hi>to ſorrow after a godly manner,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.9. This paſſion is moved and impreſt, and the acts of godly ſorrow are produced by ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, and theſe different objects and matters. <hi>Firſt</hi> their own luſts, ſins, and God-provoking abominations, their vileneſs and filthineſs, and their former contempts of Chriſt, and deſpiſing, ſlighting, and rejecting his Love, Grace, Yoke, Promiſes and Kindneſſes.

<pb n="167" facs="tcp:44192:89"/>and unworthily they carried themſelves towards him, and how they turned a deaf ear to his Calls and Invitations, and made him wait ſo long for their acceptance of him, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven <hi>until his Locks were wet with the dew of the right, Cant.</hi> 5. This works grief, and raiſes great ſorrow in their hearts. So when they conſider how their ſins have ſtabb'd and mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred the Lord Jeſus, and <hi>put him to open ſhame, Heb.</hi> 6 6. how they pulled down the wrath and <hi>Curſe of God on him, Gal.</hi> 3.12. and how he poured out ſighs, tears, yea, his precious Blood and Soul for them, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53. and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe how their ſins were imputed to, and laid on him, and how he was Crucified and killed for them, and all to ſave them, and inſtate them in his own Glory and Eternal Bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. <hi>ult.

Oh! how doth this work on them? how do theſe things irritate, and cauſe ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row and bitterneſs of Soul in them? Now they can indeed look on him whom they have pierced, and mourn, and be in real <hi>bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Soul, as for their Firſt-born, Zach.</hi> 12.10. Theſe, and many other things, (which I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not now mention) do greatly melt them, and provoke holy Sorrow, and Repentance unto Life; for as Chriſt his Love, Grace, and Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, do work on their paſſion of Joy, irri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates and provokes it, ſo they do work on, and cauſe much ſorrow and grief of heart (through the helps of the Spirit) likewiſe.

<pb n="168" facs="tcp:44192:90"/>and effectually on both, namely, to cauſe joy and ſorrow in the ſame New Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Theſe are ſome of the holy, ſpiritual affections and paſſions, which are formed in the Soul in Regeneration; and if you are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed Regenerate perſons, you can (in ſome degree) experience them in your hearts; therefore try and examine your ſelves by them, if you are in a Regenerate ſtate and condition.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, <hi>The New Creature is full of ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual and heavenly deſires after Divine Matters and Concernments, Iſa.</hi> 26.8. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 10.17. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 15.15. <hi>Pro.</hi> 11.23. Unregenerate men are full of carnal worldly deſires, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.3. of which they <hi>make their boast, Pſal.</hi> 10.3. But the New Creatures heart is full of ſpiritual deſires; their deſires are aſcending, not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcending; they came from Heaven, and like Fire, they do naturally bend and aſcend thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from whence they came; they greatly deſire to be holy and conformable in heart and life to the Will of God; they greatly deſire to know and ſee Jeſus Chriſt, and to have intimate and conſtant Communion with him, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 63.1, 2. <hi>Exod.</hi> 33. They that are Regenerated, deſire the death and deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of all their Luſts, and the thorough clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of their hearts of all ſin, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51. <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.

They deſire that
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:44192:90"/>Chriſt may rule in their hearts, and that he will pull down all his Enemies there, that ſo he may Reign alone, ſo as that they may not ſerve ſin, or carnal Self any more; they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fire to have their hearts always in Heaven, and to be ſpiritually-minded continually; they deſire the <hi>coming of Chriſt, and that his Kingdom may be eſtabliſhed above the tops of the Mountains, and be exalted above the Hills, Iſa.</hi> 2.2, 3. <hi>Rev.</hi> 22. <hi>ult.</hi> They deſire that <hi>his Name may be great among the Gentiles,</hi> and find ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance among the <hi>Jews.</hi> They deſire that the <hi>Goſpel may run and be glorified,</hi> and find acceptance among all ſorts of men; and they deſire to ſee a great Spirit of Humility, Zeal, and Goſpel-Holineſs, upon Profeſſors of the good ways of Jeſus Chriſt. In a word, they deſire whatever God tells them he deſires of, or for them. Doth God deſire them to <hi>be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in all manner of Converſation, and to be fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in every good work;</hi> why, they deſire the ſame too? Doth God will and deſire that they ſhould <hi>love the Brethren,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.22. be good and charitable to the poor, ſimpathize with, and help them in their afflictions, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25. why, they deſire the ſame alſo? Would God have them <hi>ſingle and ſincere hearted</hi> to himſelf, and all men, and <hi>do to all men as they would have them do to themſelves,</hi> why, they do will and deſire the ſame likewiſe? Would God have them <hi>ſeek his glory</hi> in all their ways, <hi>watch and guard their hearts; render good for evil, be in his fear all the day long, Pro.</hi> 23.17. <hi>not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from God, but give him their hearts, walk with him, and perfect holineſs in his fear,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.1.
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:44192:91"/>why, the ſame they greatly will and deſire alſo. So that as <hi>Daniel</hi> was ſaid to be a <hi>man of deſires, Dan.</hi> 9.23. (margin) ſo all Regenerate perſons, are men of deſires. They are fuller of heavenly deſires after divine things, than of all other good things. They deſire to have what they cannot get, as yet, and to do that which they cannot do. But they are (as it were) made up of deſires after the doing and obtainment of them. Regenerate mens deſires are good and great deſires; they ſhew what a man is, and by them they may know their States, whether they be Regenerate or unregenerate perſons. If the deſires of a man be wholly or moſtly <hi>after the things of the fleſh,</hi> there is a carnal man: if after holyneſs, Chriſt and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly things, there is a Spiritual man indeed; For as the flood of thy deſires are, ſo art thou, Performanes are ſhort, but deſires are long, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainments are few, but deſires are many in all reall Regenerate perſons. To will and deſire they find, when they find not how to perform and act their deſires.</p>
               <p>Eightly, <hi>New Creatures, or Regenerate Perſons, are born to, and imployed in great, ſpecial, and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar works and ſervices;</hi> namely, ſuch as other men, and they themſelves were ſtrangers to before. They loathed the very names of them, and would by no means be perſwaded to mind or conſider them before. But now they are their works, their choſen, deſired, loved, and highly eſteemed works and ſervices. They are their acceptable and moſt delightful works now, becauſe they are the works of God, and
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:44192:91"/>for God their Father; and alſo becauſe their hearts and Souls are by the Grace of Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration ſuited to them.

This is their care, worke and excerciſe; and that not only to love God ſimply, but to love him Sincerly, Heartily, Strongly, Purely. Fervently, and Conſtantly and Obediently. To love God as God, and as their God, as their great and everlaſting, and as their Gracious, Kind, and Loving God; to love him in the <hi>Superlative de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree,</hi> as their chiefeſt and only good. This work they love and delight in; they contrive and project it, ſtudy and endeavour to do it as they ought, and this they reſolve on, and uſe all means to obtain it. They <hi>charg</hi> their hearts with it, and lay bonds on themſelves to do it, <hi>Pſal:</hi> 18.1. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 116.1. <hi>Cant.</hi> 1.4. They uſe Gods means to help and enable them to do it. They read, hear, and Contemplate; they meditate on, conſider and apply to themſelves the great love of God to them, and his exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing great Lovelineſſe, to ſtir up and inflame their love to him againe. They pray impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunately and frequently to him, to ſhed abroad more of his love into their hearts, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal himſelf in his Love and Grace unto their Souls, that they may thereby be quickened, moved, and enabled to love him more Cordial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and ardently. They are ſo ſet upon it, and ſo greedy after it, and they do ſo deſire and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vet it, as that they are never ſatisfied with the degree and excerciſe of their love to God: But are unregenerate men imployed ſo in this work; no not in the leaſt, For <hi>they have not the love of God in their hearts, Joh.</hi> 5.42. Their
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:44192:92"/>hearts are not circumciſed to love God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are not Regenerated, neither do they love or deſire to have it ſo; for when God proffers them his Spirit to do it, they refuſe and reject him, and will not have him to concern himſelf with them in that matter, <hi>Pro.</hi> 1.23.24. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 63. <hi>Gen.</hi> 6. Well then, try your ſelves by this; what can you ſay to it? Is this ſpecial work of Regenerate men your work, or is it not? Be you ſure of it, that if you be Regenerated, or born again, it is your work and buſineſs? But if it be not, you are yet in your old and unregenerate ſtates.</p>
               <p n="2">2. They are exerciſed and imployed about the good work, <hi>of ſearching out their own ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities, and to find out the Plagues, Errours, and deceits of their own hearts and ways, that they may repent of their ſins, and mend what they find amiſs.</hi> To reform what ought to be reformed, and to remove whatever is hurtful to their Souls, or diſpleaſing to God; that they may ſee more cauſe of Self-abaſement, and be excited and provoked to walk more <hi>circumſpectly and hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly with their God, Micah</hi> 6.8. <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.15. This is not the work that Regenerate men are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed about; no, but on the contrary, they labour to <hi>hide their ſins, Pro.</hi> 28.13. <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.20. and to live in continual ignorance of their hearts, ſtates, and ways, that ſo they may live in peace and quietneſs at home, and not be troubled at the ſight of them. They love and delight in their iniquities, and they work and practiſe what they love, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 62.4. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 66.3. They let their own ſins alone, they neither
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:44192:93"/>deſire nor endeavour to know them, but they are (eſpecially ſome of them) great <hi>enquirers after, and ſearchers</hi> into others tranſgreſſions; which clearly demonſtrates, that whatever they do profeſs to be, yet they <hi>are hypocrites, Pſal.</hi> 64.6. <hi>Mark</hi> 32. <hi>Luke</hi> 6.7. <hi>Luke</hi> 20.20. <hi>Greater and more certain ſign of a Hypocrite</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be found than this, namely, for a man that profeſſes godlineſs, to be willingly igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of his own ſtate and ſins, and to be a Pryer and Searcher into other mens, without a clear Call from God ſo to do. This the <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites</hi> deal with Chriſt and <hi>Paul,</hi> that they might <hi>find occaſion</hi> to Charge, Cenſure, and Judge them, as the aforeſaid Scriptures ſhew, and in 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.12. But it is otherwiſe with Regenerate men; they hate and abhor that filthy odious wickedneſs of others, and make it one part of their buſineſs to know them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and the evils of their own hearts and ways, <hi>Job</hi> 13.23. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 77.6. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 21.1. They cry and pray, they call and wait on God to ſhew them all their luſts and ſins, ſuch is the deſire and fervency of their hearts in this matter, <hi>Job</hi> 34.32. This is their work, and this they do conſcientiouſly, ſeriouſly, fervently, heartily, and frequently; and that as their duty, work, and buſineſs, in all ſtates, tryals, and conditions whatſoever: For they are <hi>jealous and ſuſpitious,</hi> not of others, but of their own deceitful hearts. Thus they do; and when they have made any new diſcovery of their ſins, they bleſs God for their ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs; and then they fall to another work.</p>

In 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.1-3. <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>what manner of love is this, that we ſhould be called the Children of God.</hi> This is a great and high priviledge indeed. Well, but what are they imployed about, and exerciſed in? Is it in <hi>making proviſion for the fleſh, to fulfil the luſts thereof,</hi> as unregene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate men do? <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. <hi>ult.</hi> no, but the clean contrary; namely, to purifie themſelves, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.3. <hi>Every man that hath this hope in him, purifies himſelf, even as he is pure.</hi> The like we have mentioned, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.24. <hi>And they that are Chriſts, have crucified the fleſh, with the affections and luſts.</hi> That is, they have not fully done and effected it, but they are ſeriouſly, dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently, and ſincerely imploying and exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing themſelves in and about that work and great concern of theirs.</p>
               <p>This is another of their peculiar and ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al works, and this they do and proſecute with <hi>ſervent prayer</hi> to God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51.7. <hi>O purge and waſh me, that I may be clean:</hi> And <hi>O wretched man that I am</hi> (ſays <hi>Paul) who ſhall deliver me from

And as they pray for it frequently and fervently, ſo they do meditate on, and apply the Blood and Death of Chriſt to themſelves, for the effect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it, and that as Gods <hi>Ordinance and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment</hi> for that end, <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.14. <hi>Who gave himſelf to redeem us from all iniquity, and to puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie unto himſelf a peculiar people.</hi> They apply themſelves unto, and uſe all Gods means for the accompliſhment of it; as <hi>Faſting,</hi> the <hi>Lords Supper,</hi> and <hi>hearing the Goſpel preached,</hi> which God hath appointed to <hi>mortifie their luſts,</hi> and to <hi>purifie and clean</hi> their hearts, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.25, 26. <hi>John</hi> 15.3. <hi>John</hi> 17.17. <hi>Every word of God is pure;</hi> and the ſincere preaching and hearing of it, is a powerful means to kill our luſts, and purifie our hearts, when heard and recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in Faith for that end, as Gods Ordinance, <hi>Acts</hi> 15.9. <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.2. This they know, and therefore they uſe them, or for that end and purpoſe, as well as for light and comfort.</p>
               <p>But what is the work and buſineſs of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regenerate men, or what do they in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter? Truly nothing at all; They do neither underſtand, or like it; but are perfect ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers and enemies to it; there is no principle in them to do it withal, neither do they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire there ſhould be; their minds and thoughts are wholly taken up about making proviſion for their Pride, Covetouſneſs, Carnal Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, Vain Glory, Good Opinion of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and other filthy Luſts: and <hi>they make themſelves their Drudges, and humble ſervants, Rom.</hi> 13. <hi>ult.</hi> And hence they are ſaid <hi>to ſerve
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:44192:94"/>ſin, Rom.</hi> 6.6.17.20. But new Creatures know and account their Luſts their greateſt Enemies, and proſecute them with implacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble enmity and hatred. They know either they muſt deſtroy their Luſts, or they will deſtroy them. They know that they have trucifyed the Son of God, and put him to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen ſhame; and they know that they have greatly <hi>wronged their own Souls, Pro.</hi> 8. <hi>ult.</hi> And therefore they will give them no <hi>Quarter,</hi> but ſtab them to the heart, whatever it coſt them to do it.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Watching.</hi> They are called to, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in the work of watching and guarding themſelves, againſt all their enemies. This is another of their Special and peculiar works and buſineſſes.

Regenerate men are beſet with enemies, which watch their opportunities to aſſault and betray them, and that they know. They know that Satan watches them, and Luſts watch, and the world watches to hurt and miſchief their
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:44192:95"/>Souls, and therefore they watch them, and prepare againſt them. It is true, that good men are apt to be too negligent in this duty, and need ſtirings up to it, and it is as true, that they do ordinarily practice this duty and worke. They are moved to it (1) by the <hi>will and command</hi> of God. God requires them to watch &amp; guard themſelves, <hi>Mark</hi> 13.33, 34, 37. (1) Their own hearts, <hi>Pro.</hi> 4.23. <hi>Keep thy heart with all diligence.</hi> (2) the <hi>Devil,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.8. <hi>Be Sober, be Vigilant, for your adverſary the Devil as a Roaring Lion, walketh about, ſeeking whom he may devour.</hi> (3) The <hi>World, Luk.</hi> 21.34.36. (4) To <hi>watch unto prayer</hi> and all other duties, <hi>Col.</hi> 4. and <hi>Acts</hi> 20.31. (1) The Calls to, and opportunities for them, that through heed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſneſs and inadvertency we let them not ſlip away from us, without imbracing and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving them to the Glory of God and our Souls profit, or advantage of others. (2) That we may cloſe in, and joyn Iſſues with God and his deſignes in giving them to us, and that in the time and ſeaſon of them, and that freely and readily. (2) They are moved to a fervent attendance on this work and duty, by and from <hi>their dangers.</hi> They are in conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual danger of aſſaults and ſurprizalls from them, and therefore they muſt be always upon their watch; to prevent their deſigns, diſcover their plots, and foyl them in their Attempts. (3) From their own ſecurity and comfort, they are moved to this worke. It is eaſier keeping an Enemy out of the <hi>Gariſon</hi> of the

This I ſay is the work and imployment of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate perſons; they, and they only, live in the practice of it. Unregenerate perſons do no way concern themſelves in this great and ſpecial work. They know it not, they love it not, neither have they hearts to do it withal. They think it a work of <hi>ſupererogation,</hi> and that ſuch as are buſied about it, are more ſtrict and preciſe than they ſhould be. They fear neither God, Sin, World, nor Devil, neither are they ſenſible of the danger they are in of deſtruction; but go on ſecurely in the wayes
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:44192:96"/>of their own hearts, and ſpeak peace unto themſelves, preſuming that no evil ſhall come to them.</p>

Theſe are their good things, and they allure and draw their minds and affections to them. In them, and the contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation of them, do they delight. They feel, taſte, and ſee the Goodneſs of them, and are greatly enamored with them. They have their hearts, and that cauſes them ſo much to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe

About them, their minds, judgments, underſtandings, conſciences, wills, affections, and their all are buſied and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed, and that, as in and about their own proper and conſtant work and buſineſs. But other men do wholly mind, work, and imploy themſelves in other matters, not at all in theſe. They onely <hi>mind and follow the things of the Fleſh,</hi> whilſt others do moſtly <hi>mind the things of the Spirit, Rom.</hi> 8.5.6. <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.19, 20. Rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate men do moſtly mind how to pleaſe God: Carnal men how to pleaſe them elves. Rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate men do mind and endeavour to honour the will of God and obey it: Carnal men do
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:44192:99"/>mind and endeavour to know their carnal Intereſts, and obey the will of the fleſh. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate men do live in Heaven, converſe with, delight in, and ſet their minds and affections on things above: Carnal men do onely converſe with, live in, delight in, and ſet their mindes and affections on things here below. Regenerate men do mind and endeavour to be rich in grace and good works, Carnal men how to get, and keep the good things of this world. Regenerate men do make Religion their buſineſs: Carnal men do make ſin their profits, and pleaſures their buſineſs: Regenerate men do <hi>live in the Spirit, and walk in and after the Spirit:</hi> Carnal men do live in, and walk in the fleſh, and the things thereof. Theſe are ſome of the many diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences and contrarieties of regenerate and unregenerate men, which have now been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to you, to help you to try your ſelves, and to make a right judgment of your ſtates and conditions. Therefore, do you prove and examin your ſelves by them, whether you are in a regenerate or unregenerate ſtate, yea or no. For as ſuredly, if you be regenerated and born againe, you may find many, if not all theſe <hi>marks and characters</hi> of regenerate per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in and on you. You are indeed ſuch perſons (in meaſure) within and without, in heart and life, as you have heard regenerate perſons are. And know, that if it be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe with you, and you care not to know or find ſuch real <hi>ſignes</hi> of regeneration in you, nor any other of like import; that then you
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:44192:99"/>ought to fear and tremble, judge your ſelves, and conclude that you are (as yet) in an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regenerate ſtate and condition, and under the curſe and wrath of God. And if ſo, let me in the name of Chriſt, exhort and perſwade you to go to God the Father, in Chriſt his name; and tell him how it is with you. Fall down before him; pray and beſeech him to pitty you, and give regenerating Grace; and with all Importunity and Conſtancy cry to him, and wait for him, to come and give you new hearts, ſtamp his Image and divine na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture on you; and now with all poſſible ſpeed to convert and make you new Creatures in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed.</p>

               <head>CHAP. V. <hi>Shewing there are but few reall Regenerate Perſons among the multitudes of Profeſſors.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>Q. <hi>THere are many great Profeſſors of the Name and good ways of Jeſus Chriſt in the world, which are called Chriſtians: May we think or judge them all Regenerate perſons? Are there many, or but few Regenerate perſons? What ſhall we judge of this matter, for all Profeſſors do pretend to, and would have men think them a ſingular and peculiar people; ſuch as are in a good and happy ſtate and condition; in which they cannot be, except they are indeed Regenerated.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> That there are many great and high Profeſſors of the holy Name, and good ways of Jeſus Chriſt, is certain; and that there are but few really Regenerate perſons among them, is as certain too. That they have the Name, and do own themſelves Chriſtians, is alſo apparent; but that they are not ſuch in Truth (I mean the greater number) is clear and notorious, as will appear by and by. That they do pretend to, and would have men think them to be (what they are not indeed) namely, a ſingular and peculiar, and a happy people, is clear, and that they are not ſo, or ſuch as they pretend to be, is evident alſo. Now this I ſhall (the Lord helping) prove and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate to you, as well as I can, and I am
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:44192:100"/>ſure I have clear proof for what I ſay. That there are but a ſmall number of Regenerate perſons in the world, <hi>Comparatively,</hi> or if com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to the number of ſuch as ſeem or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs to be ſuch, I ſhall evince by many Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Teſtimonies, <hi>Math.</hi> 7, 14. <hi>Becauſe ſtrait is the Gate, and narrow is the way that leadeth to life, and few there be that find it. Mark</hi> it, <hi>few</hi> there be that find it, namely, among, or of thoſe that <hi>ſeek it,</hi> which the moſt of men do not. They do not ſo much as ſeek to be Regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and ſaved in the Lords way. But of them who do really (though not rightly) ſeek to enter in at the ſtrait Gate: I ſay, that ſuch Profeſſors ſhall not find it. This is further confirmed in <hi>Luke</hi> 13, 24. <hi>Strive to enter in at the ſtrait Gate,</hi> (ſays Chriſt) why, <hi>becauſe many ſhall ſeek to enter in, and ſhall not be able.</hi> Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther teſtimony is in <hi>Math.</hi> 20, 16. <hi>For many are called, but few are choſen:</hi> So <hi>Math.</hi> 22, 14. Chriſt calls his People, <hi>A little Flock, fear not little Flock,</hi> (ſays Chriſt) to and of his true Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, <hi>Lu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>.</hi> 12, 32. And the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> aſſures us; <hi>Rom.</hi> 9, 27. That <hi>although the number of the Children of Iſrael be as the ſand of the Sea, a Rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant ſhall be ſaved.</hi> Now, who or what kind of men were they which are ſo innumerable, and ſhould not be ſaved were they the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theniſh world, ſuch as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.12. <hi>Are ſtrangers, without hope, and without God in the world:</hi> No, they were the Seed of <hi>Abraham, John</hi> 8, 37. <hi>To whom appertained the Adoption, and the Glory, and the Covenants, and the giving of the Law, and the ſervice of God, and the
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:44192:101"/>Promiſes, Rom.</hi> 9, 4. They were <hi>Jews by nature, and not ſinners of the Gentiles,</hi> of whom he ſpeaks, that they ſhould periſh and be damned. And yet there was amongſt them a little flock, a ſmall Remnant that ſhould be ſaved; but theſe were comparatively, very few. For what is a ſmall Remnant in number, compared with the innumerable ſands of the Sea. God tells us in, <hi>Jer.</hi> 3.14. That <hi>he will take one of a City, and two of a family, and bring them to Sion.</hi> What is one or two to a City and Tribe, where were many thouſands? and yet you ſee theſe are the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Regenerated and ſaved perſons. Thus you ſee the Truth Cleared and confirmed by many expreſs Scriptures. But I ſhall further prove and explain this Truth, namely, that there are but a very few Regenerate men com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paritively to the multitude of high Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors, thus. Firſt, the Scripture, or the holy God in his Word, ſhews us, that there are but a few, a very ſmall number that ſhall be ſaved (as was ſhewed) therefore there are but a few Regenerated; for all Regenerate perſons ſhall be ſaved, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1, 3, 4, 5. The Lord Jeſus that knows the number of them to a man, having all their <hi>Names</hi> in the <hi>Book of Life, and calls them all by their Names, Revel.</hi> 21, <hi>ult. Joh.</hi> 10, 3. tells us ſo, and he knows very well what he ſaith: He is the Truth its ſelf, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.6. and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore cannot deceive us, in and by what he ſpeaks. We are taught this Doctrine by Chriſt, and therefore we may and muſt believe it as a real Truth: He certainly knows their perſons, and number, though he keeps that
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:44192:101"/>to himſelf, as a ſecret not fit for us to know. But although ſimply they are a great number, (no doubt on't) yet if compared to the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber or multiude of unregenerate Profeſſors, they are but a very ſmall number. For (ſays the Lord Jeſus) <hi>Many are called, but few are cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen, Math.</hi> 23, 16. that is, many come to the Word and Ordinances of the Goſpel, and there they are called upon to come to Chriſt, and believe in him: but they do not, will not come to him, nor accept him on his own tearms, <hi>John</hi> 5.40. But why not, why will they not anſwer Chriſts call, and come in on his Invitation? why, becauſe they are not choſen. To the ſame purpoſe he ſpeaks in <hi>John</hi> 10, 26. <hi>But ye believe not, becauſe ye are not of my Sheep, as I ſaid unto you.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>This Truth is further evidenced by their general frames, walking, and want af all thoſe qualifications and Attainments that all new Creatures or Regenerate perſons have.</hi> Regenerate men are Singular and peculiar men, <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.14. <hi>Caleb</hi> was a man of <hi>another Spirit and followed God fully; Numb.</hi> 14.24. he was of a choice, ſingular and Peculiar Spirit; much above and different from the Spirit of the Generality of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation with whom he walked. So all the Children of God are perſons of another, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, of a Choice, Singular and Peculiar ſpirit. They differ as much from other men, as Gold from droſs, Light from darkneſs, and in ſome ſenſe, as good from evil. Their frames of heart, their qualifications and atttainments, and their carriages and walkings towards God
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:44192:102"/>and men, are vaſtly different; for Regenerate men are men of other Spirits. They are (1) <hi>knowing men:</hi> they <hi>ſee and diſcern Spiritual things Spiritually, Eph.</hi> 1.18. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.12.13.14. They are <hi>Children of light, Eph.</hi> 5.8. But all others are <hi>Children of darkneſs, Eph.</hi> 5.8. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.9. Now how few are their Comparatively, that have the eies of their underſtandings thus en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightned? how few are their that ſee and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the things of God, and the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, with a Spiritual Judgment and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning? Regenerate men, <hi>are men of wiſdome, Mica.</hi> 6.9. they have hidden wiſdom of God and divine things in them, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.7. But how few Spiritually wiſe Profeſſors of the Goſpel are there to be found? All other men are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>fools</hi> in ſcripture, <hi>Pro.</hi> 1.7, 22, 32. <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 5, 1. <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.15.</p>
               <p n="2">2. How few are there among the multitudes of Profeſſors, that can indeed experience <hi>a real Change of heart and State?</hi> many, very many are reformed and have the outſide changed, and that they think is Regeneration, when it is but a Reformation of their own, not a work of God on their hearts, making them new within, and changing their frame, habits and courſe. <hi>Nice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demus</hi> was a reformed, but not a new man; his outſide was clean, but his heart and Soul was unſanctified and in darkneſs, and ſo were the Scribes and Phariſees too, <hi>Math.</hi> 23.26, 27, 28. and <hi>Paul</hi> was in the ſame plight and condition likewiſe, before his converſation or Regeneration, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.4, 5, 6. <hi>Acts</hi> 23.1. <hi>Concerning the Law</hi> (ſays he) <hi>I was blamleſs; and

Rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate men are ſo delivered from Satan and brought out of his kingdome, as never more to return again to their old Service and bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage.

The matter of the Law is the Rule of your o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, as it is the Revelation of the mind and will of God, and as his Authority over you, is in it, requiring your ſubjection and conformity thereunto; ſo you are under it, and it commands you: but not ſimply as a Law of workes, as in its firſt make, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulgation, for and to men as Gods reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Creatures; and by, or as reſpecting him as their Creator and Sovereign Lord, only or moſtly: no, but as their reconciled Father and God, and reſpecting them as his Children, <hi>begotten by him unto Obedience,</hi> that is, Goſpel filial obedience and newneſs of Life, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.3.4. <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.4. <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.6.

It is a choice mercy and a great priviledge to have our Conſciences ſpeaking to us, telling us of, and accuſing us for Sinning, and to have the paſſion of fear in us, to affright us from, and keep or hold us back from ſin. But it is a grevious bondage to be, and lye under that guilt, which binds us over to puniſhment, and that which makes us afraid of God, his Law and Juſtice; filling us with amazing, diſquieting, and dreadful thoughts of God. Or elſe God would not have promiſed to give his people deliverance from them, as his great mercy and kindneſs to them in Chriſt, as he hath done, <hi>Pro.</hi> 1. <hi>ult. Luk.</hi> 1.73.74. And Chriſt would not have ſhed his pretious blood for their deliverance, as he hath done, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.14. if the one had not been a great Judgment to them, namely, their being under ſuch Guilt and fears; and their delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance from them, their great and invaluable mercy.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>You are freed from the curſe and wrath of God.</hi> For in and by Regeneration you are enabled

It is as ſure, as if you had the whole already in your own hands, and you muſt believe and expect it; for neither height nor depth, nor any thing ſhall prevent or diſappoint you of it.

               <p>Q. <hi>WHat is the Work? or what are the works and duties of New-Creatures in their Regenerate ſtates? how ought they to walk, and carry themſelves towards God and Men? what doth God require of, and expect from them?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> They have great and ſpecial works and duties to do and perform to God and Men, in which they muſt exerciſe and imploy them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves all their days. They muſt never be Idle and <hi>unfruitful in the knowledge of Chriſt,</hi> or their new States, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.8. Regenerate perſons muſt <hi>abound in the work of the Lord,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. <hi>ult.</hi> and make it their whole work and buſineſs to <hi>bring forth fruit to God, Rom.</hi> 7.4. that <hi>God may be glorified in and by them, John</hi> 15.8. God expects ſingular things, and ſpecial works from you, for the whole <hi>Revenue</hi> of his Glory, is intruſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with, and in your hands, and with other of his New Creatures, and he hath and will give grace and aſſiſtance enough to enable you to live to the praiſe of his glorious Grace; namely, in the practiſe and perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of all the Duties he expects and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires of you: Your whole converſation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore men, and the frame, diſpoſition, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:44192:124"/>of your hearts before God, muſt of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity be <hi>as becomes the Goſpel of Christ, Phil.</hi> 1.27. All your thoughts, cares, and abilities, muſt now be exerciſed in, and laid out about your living to, walking with, and pleaſing of God; in walking worthy of your high Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, holding up the Honour, Glory, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of your New ſtates and conditions, and in ſetting off, and commending the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of Gods Grace, and your Regeneration to all men, as you have occaſion and oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to do. You muſt manifeſt and declare in the whole trade and courſe of your lives, what and who you are; that you are indeed, what, or that which you ſeem to be in your Profeſſion. You muſt walk, and carry your ſelves as new Creatures towards all your Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, and towards all ſuch as you converſe with, and have to do withal. Your ſpecial and becoming works and carriages, muſt ſhew and demonſtrate whoſe and what you are to men; and your principles, ends, and frames of heart, muſt declare what your ſtate and condition is unto your own Conſciences, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.12. <hi>John</hi> 13.35.</p>
               <p>Now in proſecuting this Head, I ſhall briefly ſhew you, 1. what your <hi>Duties are, or what frames of heart, works, and carriages, God requires of, and expects from you, as his New Creatures.</hi> 2. <hi>What Enemies and obſtructions you will meet with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, to hinder you in your ſo walking.</hi> 3. ſhew you <hi>what Bonds and Obligations God hath laid on you, ſo to walk and carry your ſelves towards God and Men,</hi> as ſhall be opened and repreſented unto you briefly.</p>
               <pb n="237" facs="tcp:44192:124"/>
               <p>Firſt then, I ſhall ſhew you ſome of your <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>uties, and how you ought to walk in your <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>egenerate ſtates; and the firſt that I ſhall <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e ſpent in praiſing and thanking God for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>egenerating and making you new Creatures, and for thoſe other appurtenances or Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, that are joyned with, and annexed to your Regeneration. Your happineſs, and the love and kindneſs of God to you in Rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerating you, are ſo exceeding great, as that <hi>Eternity</hi> will be too little to thank and bleſs God for them. Now God hath therefore made you New Creatures, and delivered you from and out your old ſtates, <hi>put you under his Grace, and formed you for himſelf;</hi> that you ſhould <hi>adore and admire, thank and praiſe, bleſs and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie</hi> his holy Name, and his unſpeakable grace to you, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50.15. Thus was holy <hi>David</hi> his Trade and Practiſe, as you may find every where in his <hi>Pſal.</hi> 10.3, 1, 2. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 89, 1. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 104, 1. Thus. he preſſes on others likewiſe, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 105.1, 2, 3. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 118, 1, 2. And the Apoſtle charges us, <hi>in every thing to give thanks and praiſe,</hi> 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.8. and tells us, <hi>That this is the will of God in Chriſt Jeſus concerning us.</hi> You muſt thank God with your hearts; as well as your lips, and with your works and carria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, as well as with your Tongues; all muſt be exerciſed in, and employed about this work. You have grace to do it withal, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you muſt do it as becomes ſuch. A deep ſenſe of your unregenerate ſtates, and what the evil and miſery of them was: Of what you
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:44192:125"/>are delivered from, and called to, in your Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation; as alſo a deep and working ſenſe of the exceeding riches of Gods Grace, and what he hath laid out, and expended on you, to put you into a ſtate and condition to thank and praiſe him acceptably, is very neceſſary for you, to quicken and ſtir up your, hearts, and open your mouths to this great Work and Duty. God minds, and takes ſpecial no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of what you do in this matter, and alſo how you do it, and what your omiſſions are, at any time. <hi>Hezekiah</hi> had received a new life from God, and he neglects to praiſe and thank him; he did it not as he might, and was bound to have done it. This God takes no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of, and Records it for our Learning, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 32.24, 25. Chriſt healed <hi>ten Lepers,</hi> and takes notice but of <hi>one</hi> of them that retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned thanks and praiſe to God, <hi>Luk.</hi> 17.17, 18.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>Make your Regeneration ſure to your ſelves.</hi> This is your duty, and a part of your new work: this you muſt, and this you may do. God would have you to live in aſſurance, and walk in <hi>full aſſurance of Faith;</hi> and therefore he hath made it your duty, that you muſt do, and your Priviledge, which you may obtain and enjoy. <hi>Examin your ſelves</hi> (therefore) <hi>whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you are in the Faith,</hi> and under Regeneration or no, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.5. <hi>And give diligence to make your Calling and Election ſure,</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.10. Other men do not this work, neither (indeed) can they do it; for they want materials to do it aright and to purpoſe. But it muſt be one of your works and buſineſſes to get and keep
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:44192:125"/>Aſſurance of your new States; for is is your work and duty, and you will ſtand in daily need of it, to encourage, ſtrengthen, and quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en; to and in other duties, and comfortable walking with God, as you ought to do, God will <hi>Seal</hi> and confirm his own work in you, if he find you dutifully and diligently endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring after it. For he hath ſo <hi>Sealed</hi> and confirmed others, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.14. <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.30. And he hath promiſed to do it for you, <hi>Hoſea.</hi> 6.3. <hi>Pro.</hi> 2.1.—7.</p>
               <p>If you live in doubt, and walk in darkneſs in this matter; Know that it is ordinarily your own faults, which you may and muſt amend. It is becauſe you are negligent &amp; care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, and do not all you may to get and keep aſſurance. It is becauſe you ſlight and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>value it, and <hi>grieve the holy Spirit,</hi> who is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to be your <hi>Regenerator</hi> and <hi>Sealer, Eph.</hi> 4.29.30. He doth not, will not help you to Aſſurance, becauſe he ſees you negligent to help your ſelves to it. Therefore do your duty and make uſe of his meanes, by which he will do it for you; and without which he will not, but leave you in the Wilderneſs of doubts, darkneſs, fears, and heart-wounding diſtractions and perplexities.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Fix and reſolve on a Trade of Godlyneſs, and univerſal reſpect and obedience unto the whole will of God, and your duty.</hi> Mould and form, ſet up and intend in your Judgments, hearts and conſciences, a courſe, way, and trade of holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and walking with God, in conformity to his will as ſuch. Take heed, beware of deluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:44192:126"/>in your progreſs. You will be tempted and inveagled to take up with <hi>Parts and Pieces</hi> of your work and duty, and to be <hi>partial</hi> in the Laws of God accounting ſome duties indiſpenſible and great, and others little and diſpenſible; and ſo of Sins too. You will be tempted to look on this Sin as great, and therefore you muſt avoid it, (that's well) but you will be tempted to look on other Sins as little and next to none; and then diſpence with the commiſſion of them, or not be ſo careful and diligent, as you might and ought to be, to avoid and reject them. Regenerate men are too to often deluded and enſnared by theſe and ſuch like temptations, and fancies about Sin and duty, which proves very deſtructive to their peace, and communion with God, and exceedingly obſtructive to their trading in Godlyneſs, and univerſal o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, as many can ſadly experience.</p>
               <p>Therefore I adviſe you, yea, the great God adviſes and exhorts you, to get the whole Trade and courſe; the whole matter and way of Godlineſs, all your works and duties, moulded and framed in you: and take up fixed, peremptory, and unchangable purpoſes and reſolutions, notwithſtanding temptations to the contrary, to take up with, and really to practice all your duties, and the whole will of God, that is or ſhall be made known to you. Thus did <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 119.30. <hi>I have choſen the way of Truth: thy judgments have I laid before me.</hi> And <hi>I will never forget thy precepts. Verſ.</hi> 93. And again ſays he, <hi>I have ſworn, and
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:44192:126"/>I will performe it, that I will keep thy righteous Judgments, Verſ.</hi> 106. <hi>Paul</hi> and other Saints did ſo, and it proved very advantagious to them. They had their Trade and work of Godlyneſs fixed, formed, and ſetled in their Judgments, Mindes, Wills, and Conſciences. They knew, or did endeavour to know the whole ſervice of their work and buſineſs, and as they grew into Acquaintance with it, ſo they took it into their hearts and conſciences; and there it became a ſtated and a vowed inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt of theirs; which produced (as a meanes) their ſo willing, ready, ſteady, and conſtant practice of Godlyneſs, and frequent Trade, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.20. do you ſo too, and you will find the like effects.</p>
               <p>Fourthly. <hi>Take up in Chriſt.</hi> Live, walk, and Trade in Godlineſs, in, from, and by him. He is the <hi>Authour</hi> of your new ſtates and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, workes and duties, from him you muſt ſtill have freſh ſupplies. The new Creature is but a <hi>Ciſtern</hi> without him, it is he that can and muſt fill your <hi>Treaſures, Pro.</hi> 8.21. He it was who <hi>begot you to a lively hope,</hi> and ſet you in your new ſtates, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.3.4. by the vertue and influence of his Life, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.2. and it is he who muſt and will nouriſh, and cauſe to grow that which he hath begotten, <hi>Hoſea.</hi> 14.8. That which I call here a taking up in, and living on Chriſt, is the ſame (as I judge) which the Lord Jeſus calls <hi>abiding in him, Joh.</hi> 15.4.5.6. <hi>Abide in me and I in you: as the branch cannot bear fruit of its ſelf, except it abide in the Vine, no more can ye except ye abide in me. I am
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:44192:127"/>the Vine, yee are the branches: he that abideth i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> me, and I in him, the ſame bringeth forth much fruit. For without me ye can do nothing.</hi> This is your exceeding great priviledge and happineſs that you may, and your indiſpenſible duty, that you muſt, <hi>abide in Chriſt.</hi> That is, that you may and muſt take up in, live upon, derive all ſupplies of Grace from him, as from your Root and Fountain. In him are all your ſprings and he is the onely fountain of Light, Life, Strength, Faith, Hope, Peace, Joy, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation. Remember what you heard before, namely, that he is the Keeper, and great <hi>Lord Treaſurer</hi> of all your ſtock, portion, and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies. God the Father ſent and committed all into his hands for you; and therefore be ſure that you live on, in and upon him for all good. It is appointed you ſhould do ſo. God hath commanded you ſo to do, and therefore it is your duty: in and by this way and duty, you ſhall obtain your portion and all ſupplies of Grace to enable you to diſcharge your du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and perform your workes, and ſo it is your priviledge and happineſs. It is your priviledg and happineſs to have ſuch a ſtock and portion laid up and ſecured in his hands, and that you may live in and upon him, and have free acceſs to him for it. This is a duty thou oweſt to God and Jeſus Chriſt, yea, 'tis a duty thou oweſt thine own Soul. By the wiſe, ſerious, and conſtant practice of this duty, thou wilt greatly enrich thy ſelf with all Grace and heavenly ſupplies. Thou ſhalt be furniſhed thereby to every good work,
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:44192:127"/>and made a fruitfull branch in thy Generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>. In Chriſt lay all thy Treaſures, and <hi>from <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> is thy fruit found, Col.</hi> 2.3. <hi>Hoſea.</hi> 14.8. Do thy duty, and he will ſupply all thy wants, make thee wiſe unto ſalvation, and a <hi>fat and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ouriſhing Member in the houſe of God.</hi> Thou maiſt freely and ſecurely truſt him with thy all, for thy God and Father, who loves thee better than thou loveſt thy ſelf, hath done ſo for thee, <hi>Math.</hi> 11.27. <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.35. <hi>Col.</hi> 1.19. <hi>Col.</hi> 3.9. And thou that art a Regenerate Perſon, maiſt ask what thou wilt of him, and he will do it for thee; and that becauſe he loves thee; is thy <hi>Truſtee,</hi> and hath thy ſtock and portion.</p>
               <p>Fifthly. <hi>Give God thy all.</hi> Let him have thy all dedicated to him, and laid out in his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice and worke every day. For thy all, is all his, and he expects of thee no leſs then thy all. Whatever <hi>Talents</hi> thou haſt, he lent them thee, and made thee his <hi>Steward</hi> to uſe and employ them for him, in his worke and ſervice. God is the firſt cauſe, and laſt end of all thy enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: he had himſelf in his eye, and deſign, when he gave, or lent them to thee, as the great end, end he requires and expects to have the fruit of all thy Receivings. It is true that he allows thee a ſhare in them; the <hi>Comfort</hi> of them is thine, but the <hi>honour and Glory of them is his.</hi> That is his part and portion, the other is thine. And therefore as thou haſt thy part and portion in, and out of them, ſo be ſure God have his alſo, and that in the firſt place. Let him not be put off with a part of your Receivings, for he will have all or none.
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:44192:128"/>Whether he hath given, or lent thee much or little Grace, or any other good things, be ſure when thou doſt any ſervice to or for him, to lay out and expend thy all in it, as much as poſſible: for then thy little all ſhall be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted, and he will account thee a faithful ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, and himſelf reſpected and glorified by thee, not elſe, whatever pretences thou maiſt make, by way of excuſe? As you muſt not take up with a part of your work and duty, and let the reſt alone, (as was ſhewed) ſo you that are new Creatures muſt not think to put God off with a part of your abilities and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivings in his ſervice, for that is to deal deceitfully with him, and rob him of his due. He will have all or none. God requires thee to <hi>honour him with thy ſubſtance, and with the firſt fruits of all thine encreaſe, Pro.</hi> 3.9. that is, with thy all. And <hi>thou ſhalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy Soul, and with all thy minde, Math.</hi> 22.37. That is, thou ſhalt not faile to ſerve thy God with thy all. Thus <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> did <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.10. <hi>With my whole heart have I ſought thee.</hi> And in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 103.1.2. <hi>Bleſs the Lord, O my Soul, and all that is within me, bleſs his holy name.</hi> For doing this, the <hi>poor Widow</hi> was much commended, namely, for caſting into the Treaſury, her all, <hi>Mark.</hi> 12.41.—<hi>ult.</hi> Her mites was her offering to God, the matter was ſmall indeed, not worth the minding a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong men. I but it was her all, and ſo it was of great account with Chriſt. The <hi>queſtion</hi> is not about the quantity, whether the offering be much or little, but whether it be thy all or
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:44192:128"/>no. We are often tempted to put off God with part of our all, and with pretence for our ſo doing. But let us take heed and beware of this groſſe and horrible <hi>Hipocriſy,</hi> for God will not long winck at it. When we have been tempted to do ſo, then we are put upon ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dying and makeing excuſes when we have <hi>Napkind up our Talents,</hi> and not brought them forth, then we had them not; and when we have laid aſide our ſtrength, or not ſtir'd it up to practice, then alaſs we are poor weak Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, then we complain of wants and weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, when in truth it is our wickedneſs and careleſneſs. But take heed and beware of this Temptation and deceit.</p>
               <p>Sixthly. <hi>You muſt be ſingular and peculiar in all things, and in all your wayes, towards God and men.</hi> There ſhould, yea, there muſt be as great a difference between you and unregenerate men, as between light and darkneſs, good and evil. For you are a <hi>holy people unto God, Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of light,</hi> and a <hi>Special and a peculiar people</hi> indeed, <hi>Deut.</hi> 7.6. <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.8. <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.14. You are of a divine make, and of a heavenly deſcent, and are born to and for higher and more noble Acts, Works and Employments, and to more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent frames &amp; carriages than others are. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you muſt exceed and go beyond others, in all manner of holy converſations and godlineſs: that thereby you may declare, and hold forth your diſtinguiſhing Characters, and manifeſt what Grace can do, beyond nature. I ſhall for brevity ſake give you but hints of ſeveral things, that you ſhould be ſingular in. In the
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:44192:129"/>general, you muſt be ſingular in all thoſe works, frames of heart, carriages, duties, and deport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which are yours, or in an eſpecial man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner required of you, as new creatures, and which other men are unacquainted withall.</p>
               <p n="1">1. As Firſt, <hi>The excerciſe of all Graces in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal duties.</hi> In all the worſhip and ordinances of God, and in all religious matters, you muſt call up, bring forth, and exerciſe all the Graces of the Spirit. There muſt not <hi>one hooff be left behind</hi> of your Graces when you worſhip God, but all muſt be employed in it. Your faith, Love, knowledge, zeal, hope, patience, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> whatever is entruſted in your hands to worke and worſhip God withall, muſt concur and work together in the doing of it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Self-denial.</hi> This is alwaies neceſſary in all your walkings with God. For one accurſed Self or other will alwaies be interpoſing, op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing and intercepting of you, to hinder and obſtruct you, or to mar and utterly ſpoil your duties and performances. You are called off from ſerving and gratifying ſelf, to the ſerving and pleaſing of God, and you are called to the conſtant work of Self-denial; and therefore you muſt do it.</p>
               <p>Againe; you muſt be ſingular in <hi>Watching and guarding,</hi> in keeping and defending your ſelves againſt all your ſpiritual Enemies within and without, and you muſt keep on, and make continual uſe of your <hi>Spiritual Armour,</hi> and fight down all ſuch Adverſaries as raiſe up againſt you, <hi>Eph.</hi> 6.11-18. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.12 Theſe are ſome of the many workes and duties that you muſt be
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:44192:129"/>continually exerciſed about and employed in; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> which you ſhall find true peace and comfort.</p>
               <p>Secondly. <hi>You muſt expect many aſſaults and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="3 letters">
                        <desc>•••</desc>
                     </gap>ng attempts upon you, from all the Enemies of your Souls.</hi> The Devil, world and Luſts, will conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually endeavour to tempt, draw, and enſnare you to, and in all evil. They will not let you <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>one, but be alwayes watching you, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proveing all their opportunities againſt you <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

But I may not enlarge at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent. And therefore ſhall only mention ſome of the many obligations God hath laid on, and encouragements he hath given you, to <hi>walk with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">
